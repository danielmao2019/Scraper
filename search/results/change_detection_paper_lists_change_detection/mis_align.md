    * Abstract: Visible-infrared (RGB-IR) image fusion has shown great potentials in object detection based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However the weakly misalignment problem between multimodal image pairs limits its performance in object detection. Most existing methods often ignore the modality gap and emphasize a strict alignment resulting in an upper bound of alignment quality and an increase of implementation costs. To address these challenges we propose a novel method named Offset-guided Adaptive Feature Alignment (OAFA) which could adaptively adjust the relative positions between multimodal features. Considering the impact of modality gap on the cross-modality spatial matching a Cross-modality Spatial Offset Modeling (CSOM) module is designed to establish a common subspace to estimate the precise feature-level offsets. Then an Offset-guided Deformable Alignment and Fusion (ODAF) module is utilized to implicitly capture optimal fusion positions for detection task rather than conducting a strict alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in the UAVs-based object detection task but also shows strong robustness to the weakly misalignment problem.

    * Authors: Shuochen Su, Wolfgang Heidrich
    * Abstract: Although motion blur and rolling shutter deformations are closely coupled artifacts in images taken with CMOS image sensors, the two phenomena have so far mostly been treated separately, with deblurring algorithms being unable to handle rolling shutter wobble, and rolling shutter algorithms being incapable of dealing with motion blur. We propose an approach that delivers sharp and undistorted output given a single rolling shutter motion blurred image. The key to achieving this is a global modeling of the camera motion trajectory, which enables each scanline of the image to be deblurred with the corresponding motion segment. We show the results of the proposed framework through experiments on synthetic and real data.

    * Abstract: Multiple object tracking in Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) data is usually based on initial detections coming from background subtraction or frame differencing. However, these methods are prone to produce split and merged detections. Appearance based vehicle detection can be an alternative but is not well-suited for WAMI data since classifier models are of weak discriminative power for vehicles in top view at low resolution. We introduce a moving vehicle detection algorithm that combines 2-frame differencing with a vehicle appearance model to improve object detection. Our main contributions are (1) integration of robust vehicle detection with split/merge handling and (2) estimation of assignment likelihoods between object hypotheses in consecutive frames using an appearance based similarity measure. Without using any prior knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art detection rates and produce tracklets that considerably simplify the data association problem for multiple object tracking.

    * Abstract: We present a novel computational imaging system with high resolution and low noise. Our system consists of a traditional video camera which captures high-resolution intensity images, and an event camera which encodes high-speed motion as a stream of asynchronous binary events. To process the hybrid input, we propose a unifying framework that first bridges the two sensing modalities via a noise-robust motion compensation model, and then performs joint image filtering. The filtered output represents the temporal gradient of the captured space-time volume, which can be viewed as motion-compensated event frames with high resolution and low noise. Therefore, the output can be widely applied to many existing event-based algorithms that are highly dependent on spatial resolution and noise robustness. In experimental results performed on both publicly available datasets as well as our contributing RGB-DAVIS dataset, we show systematic performance improvement in applications such as high frame-rate video synthesis, feature/corner detection and tracking, as well as high dynamic range image reconstruction.

    * Abstract: Past approaches for statistical shape analysis of objects have focused mainly on objects within the same topological classes, e.g. , scalar functions, Euclidean curves, or surfaces, etc. For objects that differ in more complex ways, the current literature offers only topological methods. This paper introduces a far-reaching geometric approach for analyzing shapes of graphical objects, such as road networks, blood vessels, brain fiber tracts, etc. It represents such objects, exhibiting differences in both geometries and topologies, as graphs made of curves with arbitrary shapes (edges) and connected at arbitrary junctions (nodes). To perform statistical analyses, one needs mathematical representations, metrics and other geometrical tools, such as geodesics, means, and covariances. This paper utilizes a quotient structure to develop efficient algorithms for computing these quantities, leading to useful statistical tools, including principal component analysis and analytical statistical testing and modeling of graphical shapes. The efficacy of this framework is demonstrated using various simulated as well as the real data from neurons and brain arterial networks.

    * Abstract: Fine-grained change detection under variant imaging conditions is an important and challenging task for high-value scene monitoring in culture heritage. In this paper, we show that after a simple coarse alignment of lighting and camera differences, fine-grained change detection can be reliably solved by a deep network model, which is specifically composed of three functional parts, i.e., camera pose correction network (PCN), fine-grained change detection network (FCDN), and detection confidence boosting. Since our model is properly pre-trained and fine-tuned on both general and specialized data, it exhibits very good generalization capability to produce high-quality minute change detection on real-world scenes under varied imaging conditions. Extensive experiments validate the superior effectiveness and reliability over state-of-the-art methods. We have achieved 67.41% relative F1-measure improvement over the best competitor on real-world benchmark dataset.

    * Abstract: Describing what has changed in a scene can be useful to a user, but only if generated text focuses on what is semantically relevant. It is thus important to distinguish distractors (e.g. a viewpoint change) from relevant changes (e.g. an object has moved). We present a novel Dual Dynamic Attention Model (DUDA) to perform robust Change Captioning. Our model learns to distinguish distractors from semantic changes, localize the changes via Dual Attention over "before" and "after" images, and accurately describe them in natural language via Dynamic Speaker, by adaptively focusing on the necessary visual inputs (e.g. "before" or "after" image). To study the problem in depth, we collect a CLEVR-Change dataset, built off the CLEVR engine, with 5 types of scene changes. We benchmark a number of baselines on our dataset, and systematically study different change types and robustness to distractors. We show the superiority of our DUDA model in terms of both change captioning and localization. We also show that our approach is general, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the recent realistic Spot-the-Diff dataset which has no distractors.

    * Authors: Bruce R. Muller, William A. P. Smith
    * Abstract: We propose a self-supervised method for relative pose estimation for road scenes. By exploiting the approximate planarity of the local ground plane, we can extract a self-supervision signal via cross-projection between images using a homography derived from estimated ground-relative pose. We augment cross-projected perceptual loss by including classical image alignment in the network training loop. We use pretrained semantic segmentation and optical flow to extract ground plane correspondences between approximately aligned images and RANSAC to find the best fitting homography. By decomposing to ground-relative pose, we obtain pseudo labels that can be used for direct supervision. We show that this extremely simple geometric model is competitive for visual odometry with much more complex self-supervised methods that must learn depth estimation in conjunction with relative pose.

    * Abstract: Recent works have shown that objects discovery can largely benefit from the inherent motion information in video data. However, these methods lack a proper background processing, resulting in an over-segmentation of the non-object regions into random segments. This is a critical limitation given the unsupervised setting, where object segments and noise are not distinguishable. To address this limitation we propose BMOD, a Background-aware Motion-guided Objects Discovery method. Concretely, we leverage masks of moving objects extracted from optical flow and design a learning mechanism to extend them to the true foreground composed of both moving and static objects. The background, a complementary concept of the learned foreground class, is then isolated in the object discovery process. This enables a joint learning of the objects discovery task and the object/non-object separation. The conducted experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that integrating our background handling with various cutting-edge methods brings each time a considerable improvement. Specifically, we improve the objects discovery performance with a large margin, while establishing a strong baseline for object/non-object separation.
