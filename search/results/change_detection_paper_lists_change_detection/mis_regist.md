    * Abstract: The growing availability of very high resolution (<1 m/pixel) satellite and aerial images has opened up unprecedented opportunities to monitor and analyze the evolution of land-cover and land-use across the world. To do so, images of the same geographical areas acquired at different times and, potentially, with different sensors must be efficiently parsed to update maps and detect land-cover changes. However, a naive transfer of ground truth labels from one location in the source image to the corresponding location in the target image is not generally feasible, as these images are often only loosely registered (with up to +- 50m of non-uniform errors). Furthermore, land-cover changes in an area over time must be taken into account for an accurate ground truth transfer. To tackle these challenges, we propose a mid-level sensor-invariant representation that encodes image regions in terms of the spatial distribution of their spectral neighbors. We incorporate this representation in a Markov Random Field to simultaneously account for nonlinear mis-registrations and enforce locality priors to find matches between multi-sensor images. We show how our approach can be used to assist in several multimodal land-cover update and change detection problems.

    * Abstract: Accurate change detection enables a wide range of tasks in visual surveillance, anomaly detection and mobile robotics. However, contemporary change detection approaches assume an ideal matching between the current and stored scenes, whereas only coarse matching is possible in real-world scenarios. Thus, contemporary approaches fail to show the reported performance in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose SimSaC. SimSaC concurrently conducts scene flow estimation and change detection and is able to detect changes with imperfect matches. To train SimSaC without additional manual labeling, we propose a training scheme with random geometric transformations and the cut-paste method. Moreover, we design an evaluation protocol which reflects performance in real-world settings. In designing the protocol, we collect a test benchmark dataset, which we claim as another contribution. Our comprehensive experiments verify that SimSaC displays robust performance even given imperfect matches and the performance margin compared to contemporary approaches is huge.
