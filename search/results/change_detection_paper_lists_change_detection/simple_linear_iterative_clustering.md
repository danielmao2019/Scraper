    * Abstract: Buildings are one of the main objects in urban remote sensing and photogrammetric computer vision applications using satellite data. In this paper a superpixel-based approach is presented to refine 3D building models from stereo satellite imagery. First, for each epoch in time, a multispectral very high resolution (VHR) satellite image is segmented using an efficient superpixel, called edge-based simple linear iterative clustering (ESLIC). The ESLIC algorithm segments the image utilizing the spectral and spatial information, as well as the statistical measures from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), simultaneously. Then the resulting superpixels are imposed on the corresponding 3D model of the scenes taken from each epoch. Since ESLIC has high capability of preserving edges in the image, normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) can be modified by averaging height values inside superpixels. These new normalized models for epoch 1 and epoch 2, are then used to detect the 3D change of each building in the scene.

    * Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technology that can truly operate 24/7. It's an all-weather system that can operate at any time except in the most extreme conditions. By making multiple passes over a wide area, a SAR can provide surveillance over a long time period. For high level processing it is convenient to segment and classify the SAR images into objects that identify various terrains and man-made structures that we call "static features." In this paper we concentrate on automatic road segmentation. This not only serves as a surrogate for finding other static features, but road detection in of itself is important for aligning SAR images with other data sources. In this paper we introduce a novel SAR image product that captures how different regions decorrelate at different rates. We also show how a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used to model the static features even when the independent observation assumption is violated.
