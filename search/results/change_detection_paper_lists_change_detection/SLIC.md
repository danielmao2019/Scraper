    * Abstract: Geometric alignment appears in a variety of applications, ranging from domain adaptation, optimal transport, and normalizing flows in machine learning; optical flow and learned augmentation in computer vision and deformable registration within biomedical imaging. A recurring challenge is the alignment of domains whose topology is not the same; a problem that is routinely ignored, potentially introducing bias in downstream analysis. As a first step towards solving such alignment problems, we propose an unsupervised algorithm for the detection of changes in image topology. The model is based on a conditional variational auto-encoder and detects topological changes between two images during the registration step. We account for both topological changes in the image under spatial variation and unexpected transformations. Our approach is validated on two tasks and datasets: detection of topological changes in microscopy images of cells, and unsupervised anomaly detection brain imaging.

    * Abstract: Although low-rank and sparse decomposition based methods have been successfully applied to the problem of moving object detection using structured sparsity-inducing norms, they are still vulnerable to significant illumination changes that arise in certain applications. We are interested in moving object detection in applications involving time-lapse image sequences for which current methods mistakenly group moving objects and illumination changes into foreground. Our method relies on the multilinear (tensor) data low-rank and sparse decomposition framework to address the weaknesses of existing methods. The key to our proposed method is to create first a set of prior maps that can characterize the changes in the image sequence due to illumination. We show that they can be detected by a k-support norm. To deal with concurrent, two types of changes, we employ two regularization terms, one for detecting moving objects and the other for accounting for illumination changes, in the tensor low-rank and sparse decomposition formulation. Through comprehensive experiments using challenging datasets, we show that our method demonstrates a remarkable ability to detect moving objects under discontinuous change in illumination, and outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions to this challenging problem.

    * Abstract: Buildings are one of the main objects in urban remote sensing and photogrammetric computer vision applications using satellite data. In this paper a superpixel-based approach is presented to refine 3D building models from stereo satellite imagery. First, for each epoch in time, a multispectral very high resolution (VHR) satellite image is segmented using an efficient superpixel, called edge-based simple linear iterative clustering (ESLIC). The ESLIC algorithm segments the image utilizing the spectral and spatial information, as well as the statistical measures from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), simultaneously. Then the resulting superpixels are imposed on the corresponding 3D model of the scenes taken from each epoch. Since ESLIC has high capability of preserving edges in the image, normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) can be modified by averaging height values inside superpixels. These new normalized models for epoch 1 and epoch 2, are then used to detect the 3D change of each building in the scene.

    * Abstract: Dictionary learning and component analysis are part of one of the most well-studied and active research fields, at the intersection of signal and image processing, computer vision, and statistical machine learning. In dictionary learning, the current methods of choice are arguably K-SVD and its variants, which learn a dictionary (i.e., a decomposition) for sparse coding via Singular Value Decomposition. In robust component analysis, leading methods derive from Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), which recovers a low-rank matrix from sparse corruptions of unknown magnitude and support. However, K-SVD is sensitive to the presence of noise and outliers in the training set. Additionally, PCP does not provide a dictionary that respects the structure of the data (e.g., images), and requires expensive SVD computations when solved by convex relaxation. In this paper, we introduce a new robust decomposition of images by combining ideas from sparse dictionary learning and PCP. We propose a novel Kronecker-decomposable component analysis which is robust to gross corruption, can be used for low-rank modeling, and leverages separability to solve significantly smaller problems. We design an efficient learning algorithm by drawing links with a restricted form of tensor factorization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on real-world applications, namely background subtraction and image denoising, by performing a thorough comparison with the current state of the art.

    * Abstract: To enable progress towards egocentric agents capable of understanding everyday tasks specified in natural language, we propose a benchmark and a synthetic dataset called Egocentric Task Verification (EgoTV). The goal in EgoTV is to verify the execution of tasks from egocentric videos based on the natural language description of these tasks. EgoTV contains pairs of videos and their task descriptions for multi-step tasks -- these tasks contain multiple sub-task decompositions, state changes, object interactions, and sub-task ordering constraints. In addition, EgoTV also provides abstracted task descriptions that contain only partial details about ways to accomplish a task. Consequently, EgoTV requires causal, temporal, and compositional reasoning of video and language modalities, which is missing in existing datasets. We also find that existing vision-language models struggle at such all round reasoning needed for task verification in EgoTV. Inspired by the needs of EgoTV, we propose a novel Neuro-Symbolic Grounding (NSG) approach that leverages symbolic representations to capture the compositional and temporal structure of tasks. We demonstrate NSG's capability towards task tracking and verification on our EgoTV dataset and a real-world dataset derived from CrossTask (CTV). We open-source the EgoTV and CTV datasets and the NSG model for future research on egocentric assistive agents.

    * Abstract: The growing availability of very high resolution (<1 m/pixel) satellite and aerial images has opened up unprecedented opportunities to monitor and analyze the evolution of land-cover and land-use across the world. To do so, images of the same geographical areas acquired at different times and, potentially, with different sensors must be efficiently parsed to update maps and detect land-cover changes. However, a naive transfer of ground truth labels from one location in the source image to the corresponding location in the target image is not generally feasible, as these images are often only loosely registered (with up to +- 50m of non-uniform errors). Furthermore, land-cover changes in an area over time must be taken into account for an accurate ground truth transfer. To tackle these challenges, we propose a mid-level sensor-invariant representation that encodes image regions in terms of the spatial distribution of their spectral neighbors. We incorporate this representation in a Markov Random Field to simultaneously account for nonlinear mis-registrations and enforce locality priors to find matches between multi-sensor images. We show how our approach can be used to assist in several multimodal land-cover update and change detection problems.

    * Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technology that can truly operate 24/7. It's an all-weather system that can operate at any time except in the most extreme conditions. By making multiple passes over a wide area, a SAR can provide surveillance over a long time period. For high level processing it is convenient to segment and classify the SAR images into objects that identify various terrains and man-made structures that we call "static features." In this paper we concentrate on automatic road segmentation. This not only serves as a surrogate for finding other static features, but road detection in of itself is important for aligning SAR images with other data sources. In this paper we introduce a novel SAR image product that captures how different regions decorrelate at different rates. We also show how a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used to model the static features even when the independent observation assumption is violated.

    * Abstract: The definition of the similarity measure is an essential component in image registration. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity measure for registration of two or more images. The proposed method is motivated by that the optimally registered images can be deeply sparsified in the gradient domain and frequency domain, with the separation of a sparse tensor of errors. One of the key advantages of the proposed similarity measure is its robustness to severe intensity distortions, which widely exist on medical images, remotely sensed images and natural photos due to the difference of acquisition modalities or illumination conditions. Two efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the batch image registration and pair registration problems in a unified framework. We validate our method on extensive challenging datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and efficiency of our method over 9 traditional and state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic images and a wide range of real-world applications.

    * Abstract: We present Ev-NeRF, a Neural Radiance Field derived from event data. While event cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the measurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain discrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based vision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event cameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with reasonable depth estimates, which can serve as a high-quality input to various vision-based tasks. Our results show that Ev-NeRF achieves competitive performance for intensity image reconstruction under extreme noise conditions and high-dynamic-range imaging.

    * Abstract: As 2D-CNNs are growing in image recognition literature, 3D-CNNs are enthusiastically applied to video action recognition. While spatio-temporal (3D) convolution successfully stems from spatial (2D) convolution, it is still unclear how the convolution works for encoding temporal motion patterns in 3D-CNNs. In this paper, we shed light on the mechanism of feature extraction through analyzing the spatio-temporal filters from a temporal viewpoint. The analysis not only describes characteristics of the two action datasets, Something-Something-v2 (SSv2) and Kinetics-400, but also reveals how temporal dynamics are characterized through stacked spatio-temporal convolutions. Based on the analysis, we propose methods to improve temporal feature extraction, covering temporal filter representation and temporal data augmentation. The proposed method contributes to enlarging temporal receptive field of 3D-CNN without touching its fundamental architecture, thus keeping the computation cost. In the experiments on action classification using SSv2 and Kinetics-400, it produces favorable performance improvement of 3D-CNNs.

    * Abstract: We present an approach for estimating the period with which an action is repeated in a video. The crux of the approach lies in constraining the period prediction module to use temporal self-similarity as an intermediate representation bottleneck that allows generalization to unseen repetitions in videos in the wild. We train this model, called RepNet, with a synthetic dataset that is generated from a large unlabeled video collection by sampling short clips of varying lengths and repeating them with different periods and counts. This combination of synthetic data and a powerful yet constrained model, allows us to predict periods in a class-agnostic fashion. Our model substantially exceeds the state of the art performance on existing periodicity (PERTUBE) and repetition counting (QUVA) benchmarks. We also collect a new challenging dataset called Countix ( 90 times larger than existing datasets) which captures the challenges of repetition counting in real-world videos.

    * Abstract: Satellite imagery is increasingly available, high resolution, and temporally detailed. Changes in spatio-temporal datasets such as satellite images are particularly interesting as they reveal the many events and forces that shape our world. However, finding such interesting and meaningful change events from the vast data is challenging. In this paper, we present new datasets for such change events that include semantically meaningful events like road construction. Instead of manually annotating the very large corpus of satellite images, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach that takes a large spatio-temporal dataset from satellite images and finds interesting change events. To evaluate the meaningfulness on these datasets we create 2 benchmarks namely CaiRoad and CalFire which capture the events of road construction and forest fires. These new benchmarks can be used to evaluate semantic retrieval/classification performance. We explore these benchmarks qualitatively and quantitatively by using several methods and show that these new datasets are indeed challenging for many existing methods.

    * Abstract: Light field (LF) capture and processing are important in an expanding range of computer vision applications, offering rich textural and depth information and simplification of conventionally complex tasks. Although LF cameras are commercially available, no existing device offers wide field-of-view (FOV) imaging. This is due in part to the limitations of fisheye lenses, for which a fundamentally constrained entrance pupil diameter severely limits depth sensitivity. In this work we describe a novel, compact optical design that couples a monocentric lens with multiple sensors using microlens arrays, allowing LF capture with an unprecedented FOV. Leveraging capabilities of the LF representation, we propose a novel method for efficiently coupling the spherical lens and planar sensors, replacing expensive and bulky fiber bundles. We construct a single-sensor LF camera prototype, rotating the sensor relative to a fixed main lens to emulate a wide-FOV multi-sensor scenario. Finally, we describe a processing toolchain, including a convenient spherical LF parameterization, and demonstrate depth estimation and post-capture refocus for indoor and outdoor panoramas with 15 x 15 x 1600 x 200 pixels (72 MPix) and a 138-degree FOV.

    * Abstract: Fully- and semi-supervised semantic segmentation of biomedical images have been advanced with the development of deep neural networks (DNNs). So far, however, DNN models are usually designed to support one of these two learning schemes, unified models that support both fully- and semi-supervised segmentation remain limited. Furthermore, few fully-supervised models focus on the intrinsic low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) information of images to improve performance. Perturbations in consistency-based semi-supervised models are often artificially designed. They may introduce negative learning bias that are not beneficial for training. In this study, we propose a wavelet-based LF and HF fusion model XNet, which supports both fully- and semi-supervised semantic segmentation and outperforms state-of-the-art models in both fields. It emphasizes extracting LF and HF information for consistency training to alleviate the learning bias caused by artificial perturbations. Extensive experiments on two 2D and two 3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Code is available at https://github.com/Yanfeng-Zhou/XNet.

    * Abstract: Recent self-supervised advances in medical computer vision exploit the global and local anatomical self-similarity for pretraining prior to downstream tasks such as segmentation. However, current methods assume i.i.d. image acquisition, which is invalid in clinical study designs where follow-up longitudinal scans track subject-specific temporal changes. Further, existing self-supervised methods for medically-relevant image-to-image architectures exploit only spatial or temporal self-similarity and do so via a loss applied only at a single image-scale, with naive multi-scale spatiotemporal extensions collapsing to degenerate solutions. To these ends, this paper makes two contributions: (1) It presents a local and multi-scale spatiotemporal representation learning method for image-to-image architectures trained on longitudinal images. It exploits the spatiotemporal self-similarity of learned multi-scale intra-subject image features for pretraining and develops several feature-wise regularizations that avoid degenerate representations; (2) During finetuning, it proposes a surprisingly simple self-supervised segmentation consistency regularization to exploit intra-subject correlation. Benchmarked across various segmentation tasks, the proposed framework outperforms both well-tuned randomly-initialized baselines and current self-supervised techniques designed for both i.i.d. and longitudinal datasets. These improvements are demonstrated across both longitudinal neurodegenerative adult MRI and developing infant brain MRI and yield both higher performance and longitudinal consistency.

    * Abstract: The representations of the Earth's surface vary from one geographic region to another. For instance, the appearance of urban areas differs between continents, and seasonality influences the appearance of vegetation. To capture the diversity within a single category, such as urban or vegetation, requires a large model capacity and, consequently, large datasets. In this work, we propose a different perspective and view this diversity as an inductive transfer learning problem where few data samples from one region allow a model to adapt to an unseen region. We evaluate the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm on classification and segmentation tasks using globally and regionally distributed datasets. We find that few-shot model adaptation outperforms pre-training with regular gradient descent and fine-tuning on the (1) Sen12MS dataset and (2) DeepGlobe dataset when the source domain and target domain differ. This indicates that model optimization with meta-learning may benefit tasks in the Earth sciences whose data show a high degree of diversity from region to region, while traditional gradient-based supervised learning remains suitable in the absence of a feature or label shift.

    * Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a hot topic in computer vision where the most challenging tasks of object detection and recognition have been handling by the success of semantic segmentation approaches. We propose a concept of objectby-object learning technique to detect 11 types of facial skin lesions using semantic segmentation methods. Detecting individual skin lesion in a dense group is a challenging task, because of ambiguities in the appearance of the visual data. We observe that there exist co-occurrent visual relations between object classes (e.g., wrinkle and age spot, or papule and whitehead, etc.). In fact, rich contextual information significantly helps to handle the issue. Therefore, we propose REthinker blocks that are composed of the locally constructed convLSTM/Conv3D layers and SE module as a one-shot attention mechanism whose responsibility is to increase network's sensitivity in the local and global contextual representation that supports to capture ambiguously appeared objects and co-occurrence interactions between object classes. Experiments show that our proposed model reached MIoU of 79.46% on the test of a prepared dataset, representing a 15.34% improvement over Deeplab v3+ (MIoU of 64.12%).

    * Abstract: To address the issue where rectangular anchor boxes in object detection-based Chinese character component segmentation cannot segment semi-enclosed Chinese characters, this paper proposes a method for segmenting Chinese character components based on Chinese character structure masks. This method utilizes a U-Net encoder with ResNet as the backbone network, transforming the segmentation of Chinese character components into the generation of Chinese character structure masks. First, this study proposes a Res-CBAM module, which leverages the structural features of Chinese characters by incorporating CBAM into the residual U-Net network, effectively solving the problem of incomplete segmentation of Chinese character components. Secondly, a vector-guided supervision mechanism is designed to guide the training process of the model by designing structure vectors of Chinese characters, effectively addressing the issue of component adhesion in Chinese characters. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional object detection methods, this method can achieve fast and efficient segmentation in lightweight networks by training small datasets.

    * Abstract: Statistical analysis of longitudinal or cross sectionalbrain imaging data to identify effects of neurodegenerative diseases is a fundamental task in various studies in neuroscience. However, when there are systematic variations in the images due to parameters changes such as changes in the scanner protocol, hardware changes, or when combining data from multi-site studies, the statistical analysis becomes problematic. Motivated by this scenario, the goal of this paper is to develop a unified statistical solution to the problem of systematic variations in statistical image analysis. Based in part on recent literature in harmonic analysis on diffusion maps, we propose an algorithm which compares operators that are resilient to the systematic variations described above. These operators are derived from the empirical measurements of the image data and provide an efficient surrogate to capturing the actual changes across images. We also establish a connection between our method to the design of Wavelets in non-Euclidean space. To evaluate the proposed ideas, we present various experimental results on detecting changes in simulations as well as show how the method offers improved statistical power in the analysis of longitudinal real PIB-PET imaging data acquired from participants at risk for Alzheimer's disease(AD).

    * Abstract: We propose an approach for dense semantic 3D reconstruction which uses a data term that is defined as potentials over viewing rays, combined with continuous surface area penalization. Our formulation is a convex relaxation which we augment with a crucial non-convex constraint that ensures exact handling of visibility. To tackle the non-convex minimization problem, we propose a majorize-minimize type strategy which converges to a critical point. We demonstrate the benefits of using the non-convex constraint experimentally. For the geometry-only case, we set a new state of the art on two datasets of the commonly used Middlebury multi-view stereo benchmark. Moreover, our general-purpose formulation directly reconstructs thin objects, which are usually treated with specialized algorithms. A qualitative evaluation on the dense semantic 3D reconstruction task shows that we improve significantly over previous methods.

    * Abstract: Outdoor surveillance systems that involve farfield operations often encounter atmospheric turbulence perturbations due to a series of randomized reflections and refraction effecting incoming light rays. The resulting distortions make it hard to discriminate between true moving objects and turbulence induced motion. Current algorithms are not effective in detecting true moving objects in the scene and also rely on computationally complex warping methods. In this paper, we describe a real time embedded solution connected with traditional cameras to both rectify turbulence distortions and reliably detect and track true moving targets. Our comparisons with other methods shows better turbulence rectification with less false and miss detections. FPGA-DSP based embedded realization of our algorithm achieves nearly 15x speed-up along with lesser memory requirement over a quad core PC implementation. The proposed system is suitable for persistence surveillance systems and optical sight devices.

    * Abstract: The recent increase in popularity of binary feature descriptors has opened the door to new lightweight computer vision applications. Most research efforts thus far have been dedicated to the introduction of new large-scale binary features, which are primarily used for keypoint description and matching. In this paper, we show that the side products of small-scale binary feature computations can efficiently filter images and estimate image gradients. The improved efficiency of low-level operations can be especially useful in time-constrained applications. Through our experiments, we show that efficient binary feature convolutions can be used to mimic various image processing operations, and even outperform Sobel gradient estimation in the edge detection problem, both in terms of speed and F-Measure.

    * Abstract: Efficient and effective multisensor fusion techniques are demanded in order to fully exploit two complementary data modalities, e.g aerial optical imagery, and the LiDAR data. Recent efforts have been mostly devoted to exploring how to properly combine both sensor data using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion approach with a simpler architecture for the task of dense semantic labeling. Our proposed method first obtains two initial probabilistic labeling results from a fully-convolutional neural network and a simple classifier, e.g. logistic regression exploiting spectral channels and LiDAR data, respectively. These two outcomes are then combined within a higher-order conditional random field (CRF). The CRF inference will estimate the final dense semantic labeling results. The proposed method generates the state-of-the-art semantic labeling results.

    * Abstract: We propose a new task of unsupervised action detection by action matching. Given two long videos, the objective is to temporally detect all pairs of matching video segments. A pair of video segments are matched if they share the same human action. The task is category independent---it does not matter what action is being performed---and no supervision is used to discover such video segments. Unsupervised action detection by action matching allows us to align videos in a meaningful manner. As such, it can be used to discover new action categories or as an action proposal technique within, say, an action detection pipeline. We solve this new task using an effective and efficient method. We use an unsupervised temporal encoding method and exploit the temporal consistency in human actions to obtain candidate action segments. We evaluate our method on this challenging task using three activity recognition benchmarks.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing a dense 3D model using images captured from different views. Recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) allow learning the entire task from data. However, they do not incorporate the physics of image formation such as perspective geometry and occlusion. Instead, classical approaches based on Markov Random Fields (MRF) with ray-potentials explicitly model these physical processes, but they cannot cope with large surface appearance variations across different viewpoints. In this paper, we propose RayNet, which combines the strengths of both frameworks. RayNet integrates a CNN that learns view-invariant feature representations with an MRF that explicitly encodes the physics of perspective projection and occlusion. We train RayNet end-to-end using empirical risk minimization. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on challenging real-world datasets and demonstrate its benefits over a piece-wise trained baseline, hand-crafted models as well as other learning-based approaches.

We build upon Part Affinity Field (PAF) representation designed for static images, and propose an architecture that can encode and predict Spatio-Temporal Affinity Fields (STAF) across a video sequence. In particular, we propose a novel temporal topology cross-linked across limbs which can consistently handle body motions of a wide range of magnitudes. Additionally, we make the overall approach recurrent in nature, where the network ingests STAF heatmaps from previous frames and estimates those for the current frame. Our approach uses only online inference and tracking, and is currently the fastest and the most accurate bottom-up approach that is runtime-invariant to the number of people in the scene and accuracy-invariant to input frame rate of camera. Running at ~30 fps on a single GPU at single scale, it achieves highly competitive results on the PoseTrack benchmarks.

    * Abstract: Self-supervised learning aims to learn image feature representations without the usage of manually annotated labels. It is often used as a precursor step to obtain useful initial network weights which contribute to faster convergence and superior performance of downstream tasks. While self-supervision allows one to reduce the domain gap between supervised and unsupervised learning without the usage of labels, the self-supervised objective still requires a strong inductive bias to downstream tasks for effective transfer learning. In this work, we present our material and texture based self-supervision method named MATTER (MATerial and TExture Representation Learning), which is inspired by classical material and texture methods. Material and texture can effectively describe any surface, including its tactile properties, color, and specularity. By extension, effective representation of material and texture can describe other semantic classes strongly associated with said material and texture. MATTER leverages multi-temporal, spatially aligned remote sensing imagery over unchanged regions to learn invariance to illumination and viewing angle as a mechanism to achieve consistency of material and texture representation. We show that our self-supervision pre-training method allows for up to 24.22% and 6.33% performance increase in unsupervised and fine-tuned setups, and up to 76% faster convergence on change detection, land cover classification, and semantic segmentation tasks.

    * Abstract: Collective insights from a group of experts have always proven to outperform an individual's best diagnostic for clinical tasks. For the task of medical image segmentation, existing research on AI-based alternatives focuses more on developing models that can imitate the best individual rather than harnessing the power of expert groups. In this paper, we introduce a single diffusion model-based approach that produces multiple plausible outputs by learning a distribution over group insights. Our proposed model generates a distribution of segmentation masks by leveraging the inherent stochastic sampling process of diffusion using only minimal additional learning. We demonstrate on three different medical image modalities- CT, ultrasound, and MRI that our model is capable of producing several possible variants while capturing the frequencies of their occurrences. Comprehensive results show that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art ambiguous segmentation networks in terms of accuracy while preserving naturally occurring variation. We also propose a new metric to evaluate the diversity as well as the accuracy of segmentation predictions that aligns with the interest of clinical practice of collective insights. Implementation code will be released publicly after the review process.

    * Abstract: Prior studies on Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) reveal immense potential towards a generic model for Earth Observation. Nevertheless these works primarily focus on a single modality without temporal and geo-context modeling hampering their capabilities for diverse tasks. In this study we present SkySense a generic billion-scale model pre-trained on a curated multi-modal Remote Sensing Imagery (RSI) dataset with 21.5 million temporal sequences. SkySense incorporates a factorized multi-modal spatiotemporal encoder taking temporal sequences of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data as input. This encoder is pre-trained by our proposed Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning to learn representations across different modal and spatial granularities. To further enhance the RSI representations by the geo-context clue we introduce Geo-Context Prototype Learning to learn region-aware prototypes upon RSI's multi-modal spatiotemporal features. To our best knowledge SkySense is the largest Multi-Modal RSFM to date whose modules can be flexibly combined or used individually to accommodate various tasks. It demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities on a thorough evaluation encompassing 16 datasets over 7 tasks from single- to multi-modal static to temporal and classification to localization. SkySense surpasses 18 recent RSFMs in all test scenarios. Specifically it outperforms the latest models such as GFM SatLas and Scale-MAE by a large margin i.e. 2.76% 3.67% and 3.61% on average respectively. We will release the pre-trained weights to facilitate future research and Earth Observation applications.

    * Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) object detection but this comes at the cost of tremendous computational resources partly due to extracting redundant features within a single convolutional layer. Recent works either delve into model compression methods or focus on the carefully-designed lightweight models both of which result in performance degradation. In this paper we propose an efficient convolution module for SAR object detection called SFS-Conv which increases feature diversity within each convolutional layer through a shunt-perceive-select strategy. Specifically we shunt input feature maps into space and frequency aspects. The former perceives the context of various objects by dynamically adjusting receptive field while the latter captures abundant frequency variations and textural features via fractional Gabor transformer. To adaptively fuse features from space and frequency aspects a parameter-free feature selection module is proposed to ensure that the most representative and distinctive information are preserved. With SFS-Conv we build a lightweight SAR object detection network called SFS-CNet. Experimental results show that SFS-CNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) models on a series of SAR object detection benchmarks while simultaneously reducing both the model size and computational cost.

    * Abstract: We propose a convex relaxation approach to space-time 3D reconstruction from multiple videos. Generalizing the works [16], [8] to the 4D setting, we cast the problem of reconstruction over time as a binary labeling problem in a 4D space. We propose a variational formulation which combines a photoconsistency based data term with a spatiotemporal total variation regularization. In particular, we propose a novel data term that is both faster to compute and better suited for wide-baseline camera setups when photoconsistency measures are unreliable or missing. The proposed functional can be globally minimized using convex relaxation techniques. Numerous experiments on a variety of publically available data sets demonstrate that we can compute detailed and temporally consistent reconstructions. In particular, the temporal regularization allows to reduce jittering of voxels over time.

    * Abstract: The notion of self and cross-attention learning has been found to substantially boost the performance of remote sensing (RS) image fusion. However, while the self-attention models fail to incorporate the global context due to the limited size of the receptive fields, cross-attention learning may generate ambiguous features as the feature extractors for all the modalities are jointly trained. This results in the generation of redundant multi-modal features, thus limiting the fusion performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion architecture called Global Attention based Fusion Network (GAF-Net), equipped with novel self and cross-attention learning techniques. We introduce the within-modality feature refinement module through global spectral-spatial attention learning using the query-key-value processing where both the global spatial and channel contexts are used to generate two channel attention masks. Since it is non-trivial to generate the cross-attention from within the fusion network, we propose to leverage two auxiliary tasks of modality-specific classification to produce highly discriminative cross-attention masks. Finally, to ensure non-redundancy, we propose to penalize the high correlation between attended modality-specific features. Our extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including optical, multispectral (MS), hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and audio modalities establish the superiority of GAF-Net concerning the literature.

    * Abstract: Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging ill-posed problem that aims to up-sample a given low-resolution (LR) image to a high-resolution (HR) counterpart. Due to the difficulty in obtaining real LR-HR training pairs, recent approaches are trained on simulated LR images degraded by simplified down-sampling operators, e.g., bicubic. Such an approach can be problematic in practice due to the large gap between the synthesized and real-world LR images. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel Invertible scale-Conditional Function (ICF), which can scale an input image and then restore the original input with different scale conditions. Using the proposed ICF, we construct a novel self-supervised SISR framework (ICF-SRSR) to handle the real-world SR task without using any paired/unpaired training data. Furthermore, our ICF-SRSR can generate realistic and feasible LR-HR pairs, which can make existing supervised SISR networks more robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in handling SISR in a fully self-supervised manner. Our ICF-SRSR demonstrates superior performance compared to the existing methods trained on synthetic paired images in real-world scenarios and exhibits comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised/unsupervised methods on public benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Synthetic datasets, recognized for their cost effectiveness, play a pivotal role in advancing computer vision tasks and techniques. However, when it comes to remote sensing image processing, the creation of synthetic datasets becomes challenging due to the demand for larger-scale and more diverse 3D models. This complexity is compounded by the difficulties associated with real remote sensing datasets, including limited data acquisition and high annotation costs, which amplifies the need for high-quality synthetic alternatives. To address this, we present SyntheWorld, a synthetic dataset unparalleled in quality, diversity, and scale. It includes 40,000 images with submeter-level pixels and fine-grained land cover annotations of eight categories, and it also provides 40,000 pairs of bitemporal image pairs with building change annotations for building change detection. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets to verify the effectiveness of SyntheWorld and to investigate the conditions under which our synthetic data yield advantages.

    * Abstract: Gaussian processes provide a flexible framework for forecasting, removing noise, and interpreting long temporal datasets. State space modelling (Kalman filtering) enables these non-parametric models to be deployed on long datasets by reducing the complexity to linear in the number of data points. The complexity is still cubic in the state dimension m which is an impediment to practical application. In certain special cases (Gaussian likelihood, regular spacing) the GP posterior will reach a steady posterior state when the data are very long. We leverage this and formulate an inference scheme for GPs with general likelihoods, where inference is based on single-sweep EP (assumed density filtering). The infinite-horizon model tackles the cubic cost in the state dimensionality and reduces the cost in the state dimension m to O(m^2) per data point. The model is extended to online-learning of hyperparameters. We show examples for large finite-length modelling problems, and present how the method runs in real-time on a smartphone on a continuous data stream updated at 100 Hz.

    * Abstract: Word meaning may change over time as a reflection of changes in human society. Therefore, modeling time in word representation is necessary for some diachronic tasks. Most existing diachronic word representation approaches train the embeddings separately for each pre-grouped time-stamped corpus and align these embeddings, e.g., by orthogonal projections, vector initialization, temporal referencing, and compass. However, not only does word meaning change in a short time, word meaning may also be subject to evolution over long timespans, thus resulting in a unified continuous process. A recent approach called `DiffTime' models semantic evolution as functions parameterized by multiple-layer nonlinear neural networks over time. In this paper, we will carry on this line of work by learning explicit functions over time for each word. Our approach, called `Word2Fun', reduces the space complexity from $\mathcal{O}(TVD)$ to $\mathcal{O}(kVD)$ where $k$ is a small constant ($k \ll T $). In particular, a specific instance based on polynomial functions could provably approximate any function modeling word evolution with a given negligible error thanks to the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in diverse tasks including time-aware word clustering, temporal analogy, and semantic change detection.

    * Abstract: Given taxi-ride counts information between departure and destination locations, how can we forecast their future demands? In general, given a data stream of events with seasonal patterns that innovate over time, how can we effectively and efficiently forecast future events? In this paper, we propose Shifting Seasonal Matrix Factorization approach, namely SSMF, that can adaptively learn multiple seasonal patterns (called regimes), as well as switching between them. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) it accurately forecasts future events by detecting regime shifts in seasonal patterns as the data stream evolves; (b) it works in an online setting, i.e., processes each observation in constant time and memory; (c) it effectively realizes regime shifts without human intervention by using a lossless data compression scheme. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by accurately forecasting upcoming events on three real-world data streams.
