    * Abstract: We propose an approach for dense semantic 3D reconstruction which uses a data term that is defined as potentials over viewing rays, combined with continuous surface area penalization. Our formulation is a convex relaxation which we augment with a crucial non-convex constraint that ensures exact handling of visibility. To tackle the non-convex minimization problem, we propose a majorize-minimize type strategy which converges to a critical point. We demonstrate the benefits of using the non-convex constraint experimentally. For the geometry-only case, we set a new state of the art on two datasets of the commonly used Middlebury multi-view stereo benchmark. Moreover, our general-purpose formulation directly reconstructs thin objects, which are usually treated with specialized algorithms. A qualitative evaluation on the dense semantic 3D reconstruction task shows that we improve significantly over previous methods.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a non-local structured prior for volumetric multi-view 3D reconstruction. Towards this goal, we present a novel Markov random field model based on ray potentials in which assumptions about large 3D surface patches such as planarity or Manhattan world constraints can be efficiently encoded as probabilistic priors. We further derive an inference algorithm that reasons jointly about voxels, pixels and image segments, and estimates marginal distributions of appearance, occupancy, depth, normals and planarity. Key to tractable inference is a novel hybrid representation that spans both voxel and pixel space and that integrates non-local information from 2D image segmentations in a principled way. We compare our non-local prior to commonly employed local smoothness assumptions and a variety of state-of-the-art volumetric reconstruction baselines on challenging outdoor scenes with textureless and reflective surfaces. Our experiments indicate that regularizing over larger distances has the potential to resolve ambiguities where local regularizers fail.

    * Abstract: We investigate the use of OSM data for semantic labeling of EO images. Deep neural networks have been used in the past for remote sensing data classification from various sensors, including multispectral, hyperspectral, Radar and Lidar data. However, OSM is an abundant data source that has already been used as ground truth data, but rarely exploited as an input information layer. We study different use cases and deep network architectures to leverage this OSM data for semantic labeling of aerial and satellite images. Especially, we look into fusion based architectures and coarse-to-fine segmentation to include the OSM layer into multispectral-based deep fully convolutional networks. We illustrate how these methods can be used successfully on two public datasets: the ISPRS Potsdam and the DFC2017. We show that OSM data can efficiently be integrated into the vision-based deep learning models and that it significantly improves both the accuracy performance and the convergence.

    * Abstract: Homography estimation is often an indispensable step in many computer vision tasks. The existing approaches, however, are not robust to illumination and/or larger viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose bidirectional implicit Homography Estimation (biHomE) loss for unsupervised homography estimation. biHomE minimizes the distance in the feature space between the warped image from the source viewpoint and the corresponding image from the target viewpoint. Since we use a fixed pre-trained feature extractor and the only learnable component of our framework is the homography network, we effectively decouple the homography estimation from representation learning. We use an additional photometric distortion step in the synthetic COCO dataset generation to better represent the illumination variation of the real-world scenarios. We show that biHomE achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic COCO dataset, which is also comparable or better compared to supervised approaches. Furthermore, the empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our approach to illumination variation compared to existing methods.

    * Abstract: Building and maintaining High-Definition (HD) maps represents a large barrier to autonomous vehicle deployment. This along with advances in modern online map detection models has sparked renewed interest in the online mapping problem. However effectively predicting online maps at a high enough quality to enable safe driverless deployments remains a significant challenge. Recent work on these models proposes training robust online mapping systems using low quality map priors with synthetic perturbations in an attempt to simulate out-of-date HD map priors. In this paper we investigate how models trained on these synthetically perturbed map priors generalize to performance on deployment-scale real world map changes. We present a large-scale experimental study to determine which synthetic perturbations are most useful in generalizing to real world HD map changes evaluated using multiple years of real-world autonomous driving data. We show there is still a substantial sim2real gap between synthetic prior perturbations and observed real-world changes which limits the utility of current prior-informed HD map prediction models.

    * Abstract: Spectral signatures of natural scenes were earlier found to be distinctive for different scene types with varying spatial envelope properties such as openness, naturalness, ruggedness, and symmetry. Recently, such handcrafted features have been outclassed by deep learning based representations. This paper proposes a novel spectral description of convolution features, implemented efficiently as a unitary transformation within deep network architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use deep learning based spectral features explicitly for image classification task. We show that the spectral transformation decorrelates convolutional activations, which reduces co-adaptation between feature detections, thus acts as an effective regularizer. Our approach achieves significant improvements on three large-scale scene-centric datasets (MIT-67, SUN-397, and Places-205). Furthermore, we evaluated the proposed approach on the attribute detection task where its superior performance manifests its relevance to semantically meaningful characteristics of natural scenes.

    * Abstract: Vision models notoriously flicker when applied to videos: they correctly recognize objects in some frames, but fail on perceptually similar, nearby frames. In this work, we systematically analyze the robustness of image classifiers to such temporal perturbations in videos. To do so, we construct two new datasets, ImageNet-Vid-Robust and YTBB-Robust, containing a total of 57,897 images grouped into 3,139 sets of perceptually similar images. Our datasets were derived from ImageNet-Vid and YouTube-BB, respectively, and thoroughly re-annotated by human experts for image similarity. We evaluate a diverse array of classifiers pre-trained on ImageNet and show a median classification accuracy drop of 16 and 10 points, respectively, on our two datasets. Additionally, we evaluate three detection models and show that natural perturbations induce both classification as well as localization errors, leading to a median drop in detection mAP of 14 points. Our analysis demonstrates that perturbations occurring naturally in videos pose a substantial and realistic challenge to deploying convolutional neural networks in environments that require both reliable and low-latency predictions.

    * Abstract: The Visual Object Tracking challenge VOT2019 is the seventh annual tracker benchmarking activity organized by the VOT initiative. Results of 81 trackers are presented; many are state-of-the-art trackers published at major computer vision conferences or in journals in the recent years. The evaluation included the standard VOT and other popular methodologies for short-term tracking analysis as well as the standard VOT methodology for long-term tracking analysis. The VOT2019 challenge was composed of five challenges focusing on different tracking domains: (i) VOTST2019 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB, (ii) VOT-RT2019 challenge focused on "real-time" shortterm tracking in RGB, (iii) VOT-LT2019 focused on longterm tracking namely coping with target disappearance and reappearance. Two new challenges have been introduced: (iv) VOT-RGBT2019 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB and thermal imagery and (v) VOT-RGBD2019 challenge focused on long-term tracking in RGB and depth imagery. The VOT-ST2019, VOT-RT2019 and VOT-LT2019 datasets were refreshed while new datasets were introduced for VOT-RGBT2019 and VOT-RGBD2019. The VOT toolkit has been updated to support both standard shortterm, long-term tracking and tracking with multi-channel imagery. Performance of the tested trackers typically by far exceeds standard baselines. The source code for most of the trackers is publicly available from the VOT page. The dataset, the evaluation kit and the results are publicly available at the challenge website.

    * Abstract: Reasoning about 3D scene structure is an important component of visual scene understanding. Often, reasoning proceeds from low-level cues without resorting to full 3D reconstruction. However, existing geometric cues may require multiple viewpoints, supervised training, constraints on scene structure or information from auxiliary sensors. To address these limitations, this paper demonstrates how geometric context for a single static camera can be recovered from the location and shape of moving foreground targets. In particular, we propose methods to compute the likelihood of a static occlusion boundary and floor region at each pixel. Importantly, these cues do not require supervised training, or prior knowledge of camera geometry or scene structure. Finally, we show how the proposed geometric cues can be used to infer an ordinal depth map and demonstrate its use in compositing with correct occlusion handling.

    * Abstract: Satellite image dehazing aims at precisely retrieving the real situations of the obscured parts from the hazy remote sensing (RS) images, which is a challenging task since the hazy regions contain both ground features and haze components. Many approaches of removing haze focus on processing multi-spectral or RGB images, whereas few of them utilize multi-sensor data. The multi-sensor data fusion is significant to provide auxiliary information since RGB images are sensitive to atmospheric conditions. In this paper, a dataset called SateHaze1k is established and composed of 1200 pairs clear Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), hazy RGB, and corresponding ground truth images, which are divided into three degrees of the haze, i.e. thin, moderate, and thick fog. Moreover, we propose a novel fusion dehazing method to directly restore the haze-free RS images by using an end-to-end conditional generative adversarial network(cGAN). The proposed network combines the information of both RGB and SAR images to eliminate the image blurring. Besides, the dilated residual blocks of the generator can also sufficiently improve the dehazing effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, which fuses the information of different sensors applied to the cloudy conditions, can achieve more precise results than other baseline models.

    * Abstract: We study the change point problem that considers alterations in the conditional distribution of an inferential target on a set of covariates. This paired data scenario is in contrast to the standard setting where a sequentially observed variable is analyzed for potential changes in the marginal distribution. We propose new methodology for solving this problem, by starting from a simpler task that analyzes changes in conditional expectation, and generalizing the tools developed for that task to conditional distributions. Large sample properties of the proposed statistics are derived. In empirical studies, we illustrate the performance of the proposed method against baselines adapted from existing tools. Two real data applications are presented to demonstrate its potential.
