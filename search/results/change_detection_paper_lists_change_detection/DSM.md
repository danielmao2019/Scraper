    * Abstract: Large amounts of available training data and increasing computing power have led to the recent success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) on a large number of applications. In this paper, we propose an effective semantic pixel labelling using CNN features, hand-crafted features and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Both CNN and hand-crafted features are applied to dense image patches to produce per-pixel class probabilities. The CRF infers a labelling that smooths regions while respecting the edges present in the imagery. The method is applied to the ISPRS 2D semantic labelling challenge dataset with competitive classification accuracy.

    * Abstract: Buildings are one of the main objects in urban remote sensing and photogrammetric computer vision applications using satellite data. In this paper a superpixel-based approach is presented to refine 3D building models from stereo satellite imagery. First, for each epoch in time, a multispectral very high resolution (VHR) satellite image is segmented using an efficient superpixel, called edge-based simple linear iterative clustering (ESLIC). The ESLIC algorithm segments the image utilizing the spectral and spatial information, as well as the statistical measures from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), simultaneously. Then the resulting superpixels are imposed on the corresponding 3D model of the scenes taken from each epoch. Since ESLIC has high capability of preserving edges in the image, normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) can be modified by averaging height values inside superpixels. These new normalized models for epoch 1 and epoch 2, are then used to detect the 3D change of each building in the scene.

    * Abstract: Three-dimensional realistic representations of buildings in urban environments have been increasingly applied as data sources in a growing number of remote sensing fields such as urban planning and city management, navigation, environmental simulation (i.e. flood, earthquake, air pollution), 3D change detection after events like natural disasters or conflicts, etc. With recent technological developments, it becomes possible to acquire high-quality 3D input data. There are two main ways to obtain elevation information: from active remote sensing systems, such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and from passive remote sensing systems, such as optical images, which allow the acquisition of stereo images for automatic digital surface models (DSMs) generation. Although airborne laser scanning provides very accurate DSMs, it is a costly method. On the other hand, the DSMs from stereo satellite imagery show a large coverage and lower costs. However, they are not as accurate as LIDAR DSMs. With respect to automatic 3D information extraction, the availability of accurate and detailed DSMs is a crucial issue for automatic 3D building model reconstruction. We present a novel methodology for generating a better-quality stereo DSM with refined buildings shapes using a deep learning framework. To this end, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is trained to generate accurate LIDAR DSM-like height images from noisy stereo DSMs.

    * Abstract: Efficient and effective multisensor fusion techniques are demanded in order to fully exploit two complementary data modalities, e.g aerial optical imagery, and the LiDAR data. Recent efforts have been mostly devoted to exploring how to properly combine both sensor data using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion approach with a simpler architecture for the task of dense semantic labeling. Our proposed method first obtains two initial probabilistic labeling results from a fully-convolutional neural network and a simple classifier, e.g. logistic regression exploiting spectral channels and LiDAR data, respectively. These two outcomes are then combined within a higher-order conditional random field (CRF). The CRF inference will estimate the final dense semantic labeling results. The proposed method generates the state-of-the-art semantic labeling results.

    * Abstract: In the field of behavior-related brain computation, it is necessary to align raw neural signals against the drastic domain shift among them. A foundational framework within neuroscience research posits that trial-based neural population activities rely on low-dimensional latent dynamics, thus focusing on the latter greatly facilitates the alignment procedure. Despite this field's progress, existing methods ignore the intrinsic spatio-temporal structure during the alignment phase. Hence, their solutions usually lead to poor quality in latent dynamics structures and overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose an alignment method ERDiff, which leverages the expressivity of the diffusion model to preserve the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics. Specifically, the latent dynamics structures of the source domain are first extracted by a diffusion model. Then, under the guidance of this diffusion model, such structures are well-recovered through a maximum likelihood alignment procedure in the target domain. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a synthetic dataset. Then, when applied to neural recordings from the non-human primate motor cortex, under both cross-day and inter-subject settings, our method consistently manifests its capability of preserving the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics and outperforms existing approaches in alignment goodness-of-fit and neural decoding performance.

    * Publisher: WACV
    * Publication Date: `2023`
    * Authors: Ankit Jha, Shirsha Bose, Biplab Banerjee
    * Abstract: The notion of self and cross-attention learning has been found to substantially boost the performance of remote sensing (RS) image fusion. However, while the self-attention models fail to incorporate the global context due to the limited size of the receptive fields, cross-attention learning may generate ambiguous features as the feature extractors for all the modalities are jointly trained. This results in the generation of redundant multi-modal features, thus limiting the fusion performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion architecture called Global Attention based Fusion Network (GAF-Net), equipped with novel self and cross-attention learning techniques. We introduce the within-modality feature refinement module through global spectral-spatial attention learning using the query-key-value processing where both the global spatial and channel contexts are used to generate two channel attention masks. Since it is non-trivial to generate the cross-attention from within the fusion network, we propose to leverage two auxiliary tasks of modality-specific classification to produce highly discriminative cross-attention masks. Finally, to ensure non-redundancy, we propose to penalize the high correlation between attended modality-specific features. Our extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including optical, multispectral (MS), hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and audio modalities establish the superiority of GAF-Net concerning the literature.

    * Abstract: An object's geocentric pose, defined as the height above ground and orientation with respect to gravity, is a powerful representation of real-world structure for object detection, segmentation, and localization tasks using RGBD images. For close-range vision tasks, height and orientation have been derived directly from stereo-computed depth and more recently from monocular depth predicted by deep networks. For long-range vision tasks such as Earth observation, depth cannot be reliably estimated with monocular images. Inspired by recent work in monocular height above ground prediction and optical flow prediction from static images, we develop an encoding of geocentric pose to address this challenge and train a deep network to compute the representation densely, supervised by publicly available airborne lidar. We exploit these attributes to rectify oblique images and remove observed object parallax to dramatically improve the accuracy of localization and to enable accurate alignment of multiple images taken from very different oblique viewpoints. We demonstrate the value of our approach by extending two large-scale public datasets for semantic segmentation in oblique satellite images. All of our data and code are publicly available.

    * Abstract: Modern cameras are equipped with a wide array of sensors that enable recording the geospatial context of an image. Taking advantage of this, we explore depth estimation under the assumption that the camera is geocalibrated, a problem we refer to as geo-enabled depth estimation. Our key insight is that if capture location is known, the corresponding overhead viewpoint offers a valuable resource for understanding the scale of the scene. We propose an end-to-end architecture for depth estimation that uses geospatial context to infer a synthetic ground-level depth map from a co-located overhead image, then fuses it inside of an encoder/decoder style segmentation network. To support evaluation of our methods, we extend a recently released dataset with overhead imagery and corresponding height maps. Results demonstrate that integrating geospatial context significantly reduces error compared to baselines, both at close ranges and when evaluating at much larger distances than existing benchmarks consider.

    * Abstract: Identifying changes in a pair of 3D aerial LiDAR point clouds, obtained during two distinct time periods over the same geographic region presents a significant challenge due to the disparities in spatial coverage and the presence of noise in the acquisition system. The most commonly used approaches to detecting changes in point clouds are based on supervised methods which necessitate extensive labelled data often unavailable in real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised approach that comprises two components: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous shape reconstruction and a Gaussian Mixture Model for categorising changes. INR offers a grid-agnostic representation for encoding bi-temporal point clouds, with unmatched spatial support that can be regularised to enhance high-frequency details and reduce noise. The reconstructions at each timestamp are compared at arbitrary spatial scales, leading to a significant increase in detection capabilities. We apply our method to a benchmark dataset comprising simulated LiDAR point clouds for urban sprawling. This dataset encompasses diverse challenging scenarios, varying in resolutions, input modalities and noise levels. This enables a comprehensive multi-scenario evaluation, comparing our method with the current state-of-the-art approach. We outperform the previous methods by a margin of 10% in the intersection over union metric. In addition, we put our techniques to practical use by applying them in a real-world scenario to identify instances of illicit excavation of archaeological sites and validate our results by comparing them with findings from field experts.

    * Authors: Francesc Moreno-Noguer
    * Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose estimation from a single image. We follow a standard two-step pipeline by first detecting the 2D position of the N body joints, and then using these observations to infer 3D pose. For the first step, we use a recent CNN-based detector. For the second step, most existing approaches perform 2N-to-3N regression of the Cartesian joint coordinates. We show that more precise pose estimates can be obtained by representing both the 2D and 3D human poses using NxN distance matrices, and formulating the problem as a 2D-to-3D distance matrix regression. For learning such a regressor we leverage on simple Neural Network architectures, which by construction, enforce positivity and symmetry of the predicted matrices. The approach has also the advantage to naturally handle missing observations and allowing to hypothesize the position of non-observed joints. Quantitative results on Humaneva and Human3.6M datasets demonstrate consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art. Qualitative evaluation on the images in-the-wild of the LSP dataset, using the regressor learned on Human3.6M, reveals very promising generalization results.

    * Authors: Zeyu Zhu, Xiangyong Cao, Man Zhou, Junhao Huang, Deyu Meng
    * Abstract: Pansharpening is an essential preprocessing step for remote sensing image processing. Although deep learning (DL) approaches performed well on this task, current upsampling methods used in these approaches only utilize the local information of each pixel in the low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image while neglecting to exploit its global information as well as the cross-modal information of the guiding panchromatic (PAN) image, which limits their performance improvement. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel probability-based global cross-modal upsampling (PGCU) method for pan-sharpening. Precisely, we first formulate the PGCU method from a probabilistic perspective and then design an efficient network module to implement it by fully utilizing the information mentioned above while simultaneously considering the channel specificity. The PGCU module consists of three blocks, i.e., information extraction (IE), distribution and expectation estimation (DEE), and fine adjustment (FA). Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the PGCU method compared with other popular upsampling methods. Additionally, experiments also show that the PGCU module can help improve the performance of existing SOTA deep learning pansharpening methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/Zeyu-Zhu/PGCU.

    * Authors: Anirudh Rayas, Rajasekhar Anguluri, Gautam Dasarathy
    * Abstract: Many networked systems such as electric networks, the brain, and social networks of opinion dynamics are known to obey conservation laws. Examples of this phenomenon include the Kirchoff laws in electric networks and opinion consensus in social networks. Conservation laws in networked systems are modeled as balance equations of the form $X = B^\ast Y$, where the sparsity pattern of $B^\ast \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ captures the connectivity of the network on $p$ nodes, and $Y, X \in \mathbb{R}^p$ are vectors of ''potentials'' and ''injected flows'' at the nodes respectively. The node potentials $Y$ cause flows across edges which aim to balance out the potential difference, and the flows $X$ injected at the nodes are extraneous to the network dynamics. In several practical systems, the network structure is often unknown and needs to be estimated from data to facilitate modeling, management, and control. To this end, one has access to samples of the node potentials $Y$, but only the statistics of the node injections $X$. Motivated by this important problem, we study the estimation of the sparsity structure of the matrix $B^\ast$ from $n$ samples of $Y$ under the assumption that the node injections $X$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance $\Sigma_X$. We propose a new $\ell_{1}$-regularized maximum likelihood estimator for tackling this problem in the high-dimensional regime where the size of the network may be vastly larger than the number of samples $n$. We show that this optimization problem is convex in the objective and admits a unique solution. Under a new mutual incoherence condition, we establish sufficient conditions on the triple $(n,p,d)$ for which exact sparsity recovery of $B^\ast$ is possible with high probability; $d$ is the degree of the underlying graph. We also establish guarantees for the recovery of $B^\ast$ in the element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator norms. Finally, we complement these theoretical results with experimental validation of the performance of the proposed estimator on synthetic and real-world data.

    * Abstract: Dealing with distribution shifts is one of the central challenges for modern machine learning. One fundamental situation is the covariate shift, where the input distributions of data change from the training to testing stages while the input-conditional output distribution remains unchanged. In this paper, we initiate the study of a more challenging scenario --- continuous covariate shift --- in which the test data appear sequentially, and their distributions can shift continuously. Our goal is to adaptively train the predictor such that its prediction risk accumulated over time can be minimized. Starting with the importance-weighted learning, we theoretically show the method works effectively if the time-varying density ratios of test and train inputs can be accurately estimated. However, existing density ratio estimation methods would fail due to data scarcity at each time step. To this end, we propose an online density ratio estimation method that can appropriately reuse historical information. Our method is proven to perform well by enjoying a dynamic regret bound, which finally leads to an excess risk guarantee for the predictor. Empirical results also validate the effectiveness.

    * Abstract: Light field (LF) capture and processing are important in an expanding range of computer vision applications, offering rich textural and depth information and simplification of conventionally complex tasks. Although LF cameras are commercially available, no existing device offers wide field-of-view (FOV) imaging. This is due in part to the limitations of fisheye lenses, for which a fundamentally constrained entrance pupil diameter severely limits depth sensitivity. In this work we describe a novel, compact optical design that couples a monocentric lens with multiple sensors using microlens arrays, allowing LF capture with an unprecedented FOV. Leveraging capabilities of the LF representation, we propose a novel method for efficiently coupling the spherical lens and planar sensors, replacing expensive and bulky fiber bundles. We construct a single-sensor LF camera prototype, rotating the sensor relative to a fixed main lens to emulate a wide-FOV multi-sensor scenario. Finally, we describe a processing toolchain, including a convenient spherical LF parameterization, and demonstrate depth estimation and post-capture refocus for indoor and outdoor panoramas with 15 x 15 x 1600 x 200 pixels (72 MPix) and a 138-degree FOV.

    * Abstract: People detection methods are highly sensitive to occlusions between pedestrians, which are extremely frequent in many situations where cameras have to be mounted at a limited height. The reduction of camera prices allows for the generalization of static multi-camera set-ups. Using joint visual information from multiple synchronized cameras gives the opportunity to improve detection performance. In this paper, we present a new large-scale and high-resolution dataset. It has been captured with seven static cameras in a public open area, and unscripted dense groups of pedestrians standing and walking. Together with the camera frames, we provide an accurate joint (extrinsic and intrinsic) calibration, as well as 7 series of 400 annotated frames for detection at a rate of 2 frames per second. This results in over 40,000 bounding boxes delimiting every person present in the area of interest, for a total of more than 300 individuals. We provide a series of benchmark results using baseline algorithms published over the recent months for multi-view detection with deep neural networks, and trajectory estimation using a non-Markovian model.

    * Abstract: In many computer vision applications, obtaining images of high resolution in both the spatial and spectral domains are equally important. However, due to hardware limitations, one can only expect to acquire images of high resolution in either the spatial or spectral domains. This paper focuses on hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR), where a hyperspectral image (HSI) with low spatial resolution (LR) but high spectral resolution is fused with a multispectral image (MSI) with high spatial resolution (HR) but low spectral resolution to obtain HR HSI. Existing deep learning-based solutions are all supervised that would need a large training set and the availability of HR HSI, which is unrealistic. Here, we make the first attempt to solving the HSI-SR problem using an unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture that carries the following uniquenesses. First, it is composed of two encoder-decoder networks, coupled through a shared decoder, in order to preserve the rich spectral information from the HSI network. Second, the network encourages the representations from both modalities to follow a sparse Dirichlet distribution which naturally incorporates the two physical constraints of HSI and MSI. Third, the angular difference between representations are minimized in order to reduce the spectral distortion. We refer to the proposed architecture as unsupervised Sparse Dirichlet-Net, or uSDN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of uSDN as compared to the state-of-the-art.

    * Abstract: Standard RGB-D trackers treat the target as a 2D structure, which makes modelling appearance changes related even to out-of-plane rotation challenging. This limitation is addressed by the proposed long-term RGB-D tracker called OTR - Object Tracking by Reconstruction. OTR performs online 3D target reconstruction to facilitate robust learning of a set of view-specific discriminative correlation filters (DCFs). The 3D reconstruction supports two performance- enhancing features: (i) generation of an accurate spatial support for constrained DCF learning from its 2D projection and (ii) point-cloud based estimation of 3D pose change for selection and storage of view-specific DCFs which robustly localize the target after out-of-view rotation or heavy occlusion. Extensive evaluation on the Princeton RGB-D tracking and STC Benchmarks shows OTR outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

    * Abstract: We present an online approach to efficiently and simultaneously detect and track 2D poses of multiple people in a video sequence. We build upon Part Affinity Field (PAF) representation designed for static images, and propose an architecture that can encode and predict Spatio-Temporal Affinity Fields (STAF) across a video sequence. In particular, we propose a novel temporal topology cross-linked across limbs which can consistently handle body motions of a wide range of magnitudes. Additionally, we make the overall approach recurrent in nature, where the network ingests STAF heatmaps from previous frames and estimates those for the current frame. Our approach uses only online inference and tracking, and is currently the fastest and the most accurate bottom-up approach that is runtime-invariant to the number of people in the scene and accuracy-invariant to input frame rate of camera. Running at ~30 fps on a single GPU at single scale, it achieves highly competitive results on the PoseTrack benchmarks.

    * Abstract: Although low-rank and sparse decomposition based methods have been successfully applied to the problem of moving object detection using structured sparsity-inducing norms, they are still vulnerable to significant illumination changes that arise in certain applications. We are interested in moving object detection in applications involving time-lapse image sequences for which current methods mistakenly group moving objects and illumination changes into foreground. Our method relies on the multilinear (tensor) data low-rank and sparse decomposition framework to address the weaknesses of existing methods. The key to our proposed method is to create first a set of prior maps that can characterize the changes in the image sequence due to illumination. We show that they can be detected by a k-support norm. To deal with concurrent, two types of changes, we employ two regularization terms, one for detecting moving objects and the other for accounting for illumination changes, in the tensor low-rank and sparse decomposition formulation. Through comprehensive experiments using challenging datasets, we show that our method demonstrates a remarkable ability to detect moving objects under discontinuous change in illumination, and outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions to this challenging problem.

    * Abstract: We propose a method for creating a matte - the per-pixel foreground color and alpha - of a person by taking photos or videos in an everyday setting with a handheld camera. Most existing matting methods require a green screen background or a manually created trimap to produce a good matte. Automatic, trimap-free methods are appearing, but are not of comparable quality. In our trimap free approach, we ask the user to take an additional photo of the background without the subject at the time of capture. This step requires a small amount of foresight but is far less timeconsuming than creating a trimap. We train a deep network with an adversarial loss to predict the matte. We first train a matting network with a supervised loss on ground truth data with synthetic composites. To bridge the domain gap to real imagery with no labeling, we train another matting network guided by the first network and by a discriminator that judges the quality of composites. We demonstrate results on a wide variety of photos and videos and show significant improvement over the state of the art.

    * Authors: Zhe Li, Yazan Abu Farha, Jurgen Gall
    * Abstract: Temporal action segmentation approaches have been very successful recently. However, annotating videos with frame-wise labels to train such models is very expensive and time consuming. While weakly supervised methods trained using only ordered action lists require less annotation effort, the performance is still worse than fully supervised approaches. In this paper, we propose to use timestamp supervision for the temporal action segmentation task. Timestamps require a comparable annotation effort to weakly supervised approaches, and yet provide a more supervisory signal. To demonstrate the effectiveness of timestamp supervision, we propose an approach to train a segmentation model using only timestamps annotations. Our approach uses the model output and the annotated timestamps to generate frame-wise labels by detecting the action changes. We further introduce a confidence loss that forces the predicted probabilities to monotonically decrease as the distance to the timestamps increases. This ensures that all and not only the most distinctive frames of an action are learned during training. The evaluation on four datasets shows that models trained with timestamps annotations achieve comparable performance to the fully supervised approaches.

    * Authors: Yanchao Yang, Brian Lai, Stefano Soatto
    * Abstract: We describe an unsupervised method to detect and segment portions of images of live scenes that, at some point in time, are seen moving as a coherent whole, which we refer to as objects. Our method first partitions the motion field by minimizing the mutual information between segments. Then, it uses the segments to learn object models that can be used for detection in a static image. Static and dynamic models are represented by deep neural networks trained jointly in a bootstrapping strategy, which enables extrapolation to previously unseen objects. While the training process requires motion, the resulting object segmentation network can be used on either static images or videos at inference time. As the volume of seen videos grows, more and more objects are seen moving, priming their detection, which then serves as a regularizer for new objects, turning our method into unsupervised continual learning to segment objects. Our models are compared to the state of the art in both video object segmentation and salient object detection. In the six benchmark datasets tested, our models compare favorably even to those using pixel-level supervision, despite requiring no manual annotation.

    * Abstract: Current methods for Earth observation tasks such as semantic mapping, map alignment, and change detection rely on near-nadir images; however, often the first available images in response to dynamic world events such as natural disasters are oblique. These tasks are much more difficult for oblique images due to observed object parallax. There has been recent success in learning to regress an object's geocentric pose, defined as height above ground and orientation with respect to gravity, by training with airborne lidar registered to satellite images. We present a model for this novel task that exploits affine invariance properties to outperform state of the art performance by a wide margin. We also address practical issues required to deploy this method in the wild for real-world applications. Our data and code are publicly available.

    * Abstract: Deep models trained on source domain lack generalization when evaluated on unseen target domains with different data distributions. The problem becomes even more pronounced when we have no access to target domain samples for adaptation. In this paper, we address domain generalized semantic segmentation, where a segmentation model is trained to be domain-invariant without using any target domain data. Existing approaches to tackle this problem standardize data into a unified distribution. We argue that while such a standardization promotes global normalization, the resulting features are not discriminative enough to get clear segmentation boundaries. To enhance separation between categories while simultaneously promoting domain invariance, we propose a framework including two novel modules: Semantic-Aware Normalization (SAN) and Semantic-Aware Whitening (SAW). Specifically, SAN focuses on category-level center alignment between features from different image styles, while SAW enforces distributed alignment for the already center-aligned features. With the help of SAN and SAW, we encourage both intraclass compactness and inter-class separability. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on widely-used datasets (i.e. GTAV, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, Mapillary and BDDS). Our approach shows significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art on various backbone networks. Code is available at https://github.com/leolyj/SAN-SAW

    * Abstract: Generating dense depth maps from sparse LiDAR data is a challenging task, benefiting a lot of computer vision and photogrammetry tasks including autonomous driving, 3D point cloud generation, and aerial spatial awareness. Using RGB images as guidance to generate pixel-wise depth map is good, but these multi-modal data fusion networks always need numerous high-quality datasets like KITTI dataset to train on. Since this may be difficult in some cases, how to achieve few-shot learning with less train samples is worth discussing. So in this paper, we firstly proposed a few-shot learning paradigm for depth completion based on pre-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic model. To evaluate our model and other baselines, we constructed a smaller train set with only 12.5% samples from KITTI depth completion dataset to test their few-shot learning ability. Our model achieved the best on all metrics with a 5% improvement in RMSE compared to the second-place model.

    * Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) object detection but this comes at the cost of tremendous computational resources partly due to extracting redundant features within a single convolutional layer. Recent works either delve into model compression methods or focus on the carefully-designed lightweight models both of which result in performance degradation. In this paper we propose an efficient convolution module for SAR object detection called SFS-Conv which increases feature diversity within each convolutional layer through a shunt-perceive-select strategy. Specifically we shunt input feature maps into space and frequency aspects. The former perceives the context of various objects by dynamically adjusting receptive field while the latter captures abundant frequency variations and textural features via fractional Gabor transformer. To adaptively fuse features from space and frequency aspects a parameter-free feature selection module is proposed to ensure that the most representative and distinctive information are preserved. With SFS-Conv we build a lightweight SAR object detection network called SFS-CNet. Experimental results show that SFS-CNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) models on a series of SAR object detection benchmarks while simultaneously reducing both the model size and computational cost.

By alleviating overheads typically associated with human-in-the-loop benchmark curation we harness our massively parallel engine across 100 GPT-4-Turbo nodes scaling to over half a million diverse multi-tool tasks and across 1.1 million satellite images. By moving beyond traditional single-task image-caption paradigms we investigate state-of-the-art agents and prompting techniques against long-horizon prompts.

In this work we propose a comprehensive benchmark to gauge the progress of VLMs toward being useful tools for EO data by assessing their abilities on scene understanding localization and counting and change detection. Motivated by real-world applications our benchmark includes scenarios like urban monitoring disaster relief land use and conservation. We discover that although state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4V possess world knowledge that leads to strong performance on location understanding and image captioning their poor spatial reasoning limits usefulness on object localization and counting.

    * Abstract: Research in self-supervised learning (SSL) with natural images has progressed rapidly in recent years and is now increasingly being applied to and benchmarked with datasets containing remotely sensed imagery. A common benchmark case is to evaluate SSL pre-trained model embeddings on datasets of remotely sensed imagery with small patch sizes e.g. 32 x 32 pixels whereas standard SSL pre-training takes place with larger patch sizes e.g. 224 x 224. Furthermore pre-training methods tend to use different image normalization preprocessing steps depending on the dataset. In this paper we show across seven satellite and aerial imagery datasets of varying resolution that by simply following the preprocessing steps used in pre-training (precisely image sizing and normalization methods) one can achieve significant performance improvements when evaluating the extracted features on downstream tasks -- an important detail overlooked in previous work in this space. We show that by following these steps ImageNet pre-training remains a competitive baseline for satellite imagery based transfer learning tasks -- for example we find that these steps give +32.28 to overall accuracy on the So2Sat random split dataset and +11.16 on the EuroSAT dataset. Finally we report comprehensive benchmark results with a variety of simple baseline methods for each of the seven datasets forming an initial benchmark suite for remote sensing imagery.

    * Abstract: Past approaches for statistical shape analysis of objects have focused mainly on objects within the same topological classes, e.g. , scalar functions, Euclidean curves, or surfaces, etc. For objects that differ in more complex ways, the current literature offers only topological methods. This paper introduces a far-reaching geometric approach for analyzing shapes of graphical objects, such as road networks, blood vessels, brain fiber tracts, etc. It represents such objects, exhibiting differences in both geometries and topologies, as graphs made of curves with arbitrary shapes (edges) and connected at arbitrary junctions (nodes). To perform statistical analyses, one needs mathematical representations, metrics and other geometrical tools, such as geodesics, means, and covariances. This paper utilizes a quotient structure to develop efficient algorithms for computing these quantities, leading to useful statistical tools, including principal component analysis and analytical statistical testing and modeling of graphical shapes. The efficacy of this framework is demonstrated using various simulated as well as the real data from neurons and brain arterial networks.

In this work, a stereo 3-D reconstruction framework is outlined that is applicable to nonstereoscopic satellite image pairs that may be captured by different satellites. The orthographic height maps given by stereo reconstruction are compared to height maps given by a multiview approach based on Probabilistic Volumetric Representation (PVR). Height map qualities are measured in comparison to manually prepared ground-truth height maps in three sites from different parts of the world with urban, semi-urban and rural features. The results along with strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques are summarized.

Our first solver improves on the stereo correspondence problem for satellite imagery, in that we provide an exact image-to-object space mapping (where prior methods were inaccurate). Our second solver provides a novel mechanism for 3D point triangulation, which has improved robustness and accuracy over prior techniques. Given the usefulness and ubiquity of satellite imagery, our proposed methods allow for improved results in a variety of existing and future applications.

    * Authors: Gustavo Chau, Paul Rodriguez
    * Abstract: Video background modeling is an important preprocessing stage for various applications and principal component pursuit (PCP) is among the state-of-the-art algorithms for this task. One of the main drawbacks of PCP is its sensitivity to jitter and camera movement. This problem has only been partially solved by a few methods devised for jitter or small transformations. However, such methods cannot handle the case of moving or panning cameras. We present a novel, fully incremental PCP algorithm, named incPCP-PTI, that is able to cope with panning scenarios and jitter by continuously aligning the low-rank component to the current reference frame of the camera. To the best of our knowledge, incPCP-PTI is the first low rank plus additive incremental matrix method capable of handling these scenarios. Results on synthetic videos and CDNET2014 videos show that incPCP-PTI is able to maintain a good performance in the detection of moving objects even when panning and jitter are present in a video

    * Abstract: Foreground-background segmentation of video sequences is a low-level process commonly used in machine vision, and highly valued in video content analysis and smart surveillance applications. Its efficacy relies on the contrast between objects observed by the sensor. In this work, we study how the combination of sensors operating in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) and visible spectra can improve the performance of foreground-background segmentation methods. As opposed to a classic visible spectrum stereo pair, this multispectral pair is more adequate for object segmentation since it reduces the odds of observing low-contrast regions simultaneously in both images. We show that by alternately minimizing stereo disparity and binary segmentation energies with dynamic priors, we can drastically improve the results of a traditional video segmentation approach applied to each sensor individually. Our implementation is freely available online for anyone wishing to recreate our results.

    * Abstract: Remote sensing and automatic earth monitoring are key to solve global-scale challenges such as disaster prevention, land use monitoring, or tackling climate change. Although there exist vast amounts of remote sensing data, most of it remains unlabeled and thus inaccessible for supervised learning algorithms. Transfer learning approaches can reduce the data requirements of deep learning algorithms. However, most of these methods are pre-trained on ImageNet and their generalization to remote sensing imagery is not guaranteed due to the domain gap. In this work, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), an effective pipeline to leverage unlabeled data for in-domain pre-training of remote sensing representations. The SeCo pipeline is composed of two parts. First, a principled procedure to gather large-scale, unlabeled and uncurated remote sensing datasets containing images from multiple Earth locations at different timestamps. Second, a self-supervised algorithm that takes advantage of time and position invariance to learn transferable representations for remote sensing applications. We empirically show that models trained with SeCo achieve better performance than their ImageNet pre-trained counterparts and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on multiple downstream tasks. The datasets and models in SeCo will be made public to facilitate transfer learning and enable rapid progress in remote sensing applications.

    * Abstract: Background-Foreground separation and appearance generation is a fundamental step in many computer vision applications. Existing methods like Robust Subspace Learning (RSL) suffer performance degradation in the presence of challenges like bad weather, illumination variations, occlusion, dynamic backgrounds and intermittent object motion. In the current work we propose a more accurate deep neural network based model for background-foreground separation and complete appearance generation of the foreground objects. Our proposed model, Guided Attention based Adversarial Model (GAAM), can efficiently extract pixel-level boundaries of the foreground objects for improved appearance generation. Unlike RSL methods our model extracts the binary information of foreground objects labeled as attention map which guides our generator network to segment the foreground objects from the complex background information. Wide range of experiments performed on the benchmark CDnet2014 dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed model.

    * Abstract: Recent research on remote sensing object detection has largely focused on improving the representation of oriented bounding boxes but has overlooked the unique prior knowledge presented in remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because tiny remote sensing objects may be mistakenly detected without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes the lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet). LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing object detection. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard benchmarks, i.e., HRSC2016 (98.46% mAP), DOTA-v1.0 (81.85% mAP), and FAIR1M-v1.0 (47.87% mAP).

    * Abstract: The goal of this paper is to detect what has changed, if anything, between two "in the wild" images of the same 3D scene acquired from different camera positions and at different temporal instances. The open-set nature of this problem, occlusions/dis-occlusions due to the shift in viewpoint, and the lack of suitable training datasets, presents substantial challenges in devising a solution. To address this problem, we contribute a change detection model that is trained entirely on synthetic data and is class-agnostic, yet it is performant out-of-the-box on real world images without requiring fine-tuning. Our solution entails a "register and difference" approach that leverages self-supervised frozen embeddings and feature differences, which allows the model to generalise to a wide variety of scenes and domains. The model is able to operate directly on two RGB images, without requiring access to ground truth camera intrinsics, extrinsics, depth maps, point clouds, or additional before-after images. Finally, we collect and release a new evaluation dataset consisting of real-world image pairs with human-annotated differences and demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

    * Abstract: In real-world traffic scenarios, agents such as pedestrians and car drivers often observe neighboring agents who exhibit similar behavior as examples and then mimic their actions to some extent in their own behavior. This information can serve as prior knowledge for trajectory prediction, which is unfortunately largely overlooked in current trajectory prediction models. This paper introduces a novel Predecessor-and-Successor (PnS) method that incorporates a predecessor tracing module to model the influence of predecessors (identified from concurrent neighboring agents) on the successor (target agent) within the same scene. The method utilizes the moving patterns of these predecessors to guide the predictor in trajectory prediction. PnS effectively aligns the motion encodings of the successor with multiple potential predecessors in a probabilistic manner, facilitating the decoding process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PnS by integrating it into a graph-based predictor for pedestrian trajectory prediction on the ETH/UCY datasets, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we replace the HD map-based scene-context module with our PnS method in a transformer-based predictor for vehicle trajectory prediction on the nuScenes dataset, showing that the predictor maintains good prediction performance even without relying on any map information.

    * Abstract: The Visual Object Tracking challenge VOT2019 is the seventh annual tracker benchmarking activity organized by the VOT initiative. Results of 81 trackers are presented; many are state-of-the-art trackers published at major computer vision conferences or in journals in the recent years. The evaluation included the standard VOT and other popular methodologies for short-term tracking analysis as well as the standard VOT methodology for long-term tracking analysis. The VOT2019 challenge was composed of five challenges focusing on different tracking domains: (i) VOTST2019 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB, (ii) VOT-RT2019 challenge focused on "real-time" shortterm tracking in RGB, (iii) VOT-LT2019 focused on longterm tracking namely coping with target disappearance and reappearance. Two new challenges have been introduced: (iv) VOT-RGBT2019 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB and thermal imagery and (v) VOT-RGBD2019 challenge focused on long-term tracking in RGB and depth imagery. The VOT-ST2019, VOT-RT2019 and VOT-LT2019 datasets were refreshed while new datasets were introduced for VOT-RGBT2019 and VOT-RGBD2019. The VOT toolkit has been updated to support both standard shortterm, long-term tracking and tracking with multi-channel imagery. Performance of the tested trackers typically by far exceeds standard baselines. The source code for most of the trackers is publicly available from the VOT page. The dataset, the evaluation kit and the results are publicly available at the challenge website.

    * Abstract: We propose a convex relaxation approach to space-time 3D reconstruction from multiple videos. Generalizing the works [16], [8] to the 4D setting, we cast the problem of reconstruction over time as a binary labeling problem in a 4D space. We propose a variational formulation which combines a photoconsistency based data term with a spatiotemporal total variation regularization. In particular, we propose a novel data term that is both faster to compute and better suited for wide-baseline camera setups when photoconsistency measures are unreliable or missing. The proposed functional can be globally minimized using convex relaxation techniques. Numerous experiments on a variety of publically available data sets demonstrate that we can compute detailed and temporally consistent reconstructions. In particular, the temporal regularization allows to reduce jittering of voxels over time.

    * Abstract: The ability to detect and classify rare occurrences in images has important applications -- for example, counting rare and endangered species when studying biodiversity, or detecting infrequent traffic scenarios that pose a danger to self-driving cars. Few-shot learning is an open problem: current computer vision systems struggle to categorize objects they have seen only rarely during training, and collecting a sufficient number of training examples of rare events is often challenging and expensive, and sometimes outright impossible. We explore in depth an approach to this problem: complementing the few available training images with ad-hoc simulated data. Our testbed is animal species classification, which has a real-world long-tailed distribution. We analyze the effect of different axes of variation in simulation, such as pose, lighting, model, and simulation method, and we prescribe best practices for efficiently incorporating simulated data for real-world performance gain. Our experiments reveal that synthetic data can considerably reduce error rates for classes that are rare, that as the amount of simulated data is increased, accuracy on the target class improves, and that high variation of simulated data provides maximum performance gain.

This provides the first benchmark for quantitative evaluation of models to assess building damage using aerial videos. The second contribution is a new model, namely MSNet, which contains novel region proposal network designs and an unsupervised score refinement network for confidence score calibration in both bounding box and mask branches. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results compared to previous methods in our dataset.

    * Abstract: We propose a self-supervised method for relative pose estimation for road scenes. By exploiting the approximate planarity of the local ground plane, we can extract a self-supervision signal via cross-projection between images using a homography derived from estimated ground-relative pose. We augment cross-projected perceptual loss by including classical image alignment in the network training loop. We use pretrained semantic segmentation and optical flow to extract ground plane correspondences between approximately aligned images and RANSAC to find the best fitting homography. By decomposing to ground-relative pose, we obtain pseudo labels that can be used for direct supervision. We show that this extremely simple geometric model is competitive for visual odometry with much more complex self-supervised methods that must learn depth estimation in conjunction with relative pose.

    * Abstract: Recent works have shown that objects discovery can largely benefit from the inherent motion information in video data. However, these methods lack a proper background processing, resulting in an over-segmentation of the non-object regions into random segments. This is a critical limitation given the unsupervised setting, where object segments and noise are not distinguishable. To address this limitation we propose BMOD, a Background-aware Motion-guided Objects Discovery method. Concretely, we leverage masks of moving objects extracted from optical flow and design a learning mechanism to extend them to the true foreground composed of both moving and static objects. The background, a complementary concept of the learned foreground class, is then isolated in the object discovery process. This enables a joint learning of the objects discovery task and the object/non-object separation. The conducted experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that integrating our background handling with various cutting-edge methods brings each time a considerable improvement. Specifically, we improve the objects discovery performance with a large margin, while establishing a strong baseline for object/non-object separation.

    * Abstract: Detecting the salient objects in a remote sensing image has wide applications. Many existing deep learning methods have been proposed for Salient Object Detection (SOD) in remote sensing images with remarkable results. However, the recent adversarial attack examples, generated by changing a few pixel values on the original image, could result in a collapse for the well-trained deep learning model. Different with existing methods adding perturbation to original images, we propose to jointly tune adversarial exposure and additive perturbation for attack and constrain image close to cloudy image as Adversarial Cloud. Cloud is natural and common in remote sensing images, however, camouflaging cloud based adversarial attack and defense for remote sensing images are not well studied before. Furthermore, we design DefenseNet as a learnable pre-processing to the adversarial cloudy images to preserve the performance of the deep learning based remote sensing SOD model, without tuning the already deployed deep SOD model. By considering both regular and generalized adversarial examples, the proposed DefenseNet can defend the proposed Adversarial Cloud in white-box setting and other attack methods in black-box setting. Experimental results on a synthesized benchmark from the public remote sensing dataset (EORSSD) show the promising defense against adversarial cloud attacks.

    * Abstract: Many industrial and security applications employ a suite of sensors for detecting abrupt changes in temporal behavior patterns. These abrupt changes typically manifest locally, rendering only a small subset of sensors informative. Continuous monitoring of every sensor can be expensive due to resource constraints, and serves as a motivation for the bandit quickest changepoint detection problem, where sensing actions (or sensors) are sequentially chosen, and only measurements corresponding to chosen actions are observed. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the detection delay for a general class of finitely parameterized probability distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient online sensing scheme, which seamlessly balances the need for exploration of different sensing options with exploitation of querying informative actions. We derive expected delay bounds for the proposed scheme and show that these bounds match our information-theoretic lower bounds at low false alarm rates, establishing optimality of the proposed method. We then perform a number of experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    * Abstract: Experimentation has been critical and increasingly popular across various domains, such as clinical trials and online platforms, due to its widely recognized benefits. One of the primary objectives of classical experiments is to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) to inform future decision-making. However, in healthcare and many other settings, treatment effects may be non-stationary, meaning that they can change over time, rendering the traditional experimental design inadequate and the classical static ATE uninformative. In this work, we address the problem of non-stationary experimental design under linear trends by considering two objectives: estimating the dynamic treatment effect and minimizing welfare loss within the experiment. We propose an efficient design that can be customized for optimal estimation error rate, optimal regret rate, or the Pareto optimal trade-off between the two objectives. We establish information-theoretical lower bounds that highlight the inherent challenge in estimating dynamic treatment effects and minimizing welfare loss, and also statistically reveal the fundamental trade-off between them.

    * Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.

    * Abstract: Working memory (WM), a fundamental cognitive process facilitating the temporary storage, integration, manipulation, and retrieval of information, plays a vital role in reasoning and decision-making tasks. Robust benchmark datasets that capture the multifaceted nature of WM are crucial for the effective development and evaluation of AI WM models. Here, we introduce a comprehensive Working Memory (WorM) benchmark dataset for this purpose. WorM comprises 10 tasks and a total of 1 million trials, assessing 4 functionalities, 3 domains, and 11 behavioral and neural characteristics of WM. We jointly trained and tested state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks and transformers on all these tasks. We also include human behavioral benchmarks as an upper bound for comparison. Our results suggest that AI models replicate some characteristics of WM in the brain, most notably primacy and recency effects, and neural clusters and correlates specialized for different domains and functionalities of WM. In the experiments, we also reveal some limitations in existing models to approximate human behavior. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for communities in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and AI, offering a standardized framework to compare and enhance WM models, investigate WM's neural underpinnings, and develop WM models with human-like capabilities.
