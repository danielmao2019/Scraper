    * Abstract: We propose a learning approach to corner detection for event-based cameras that is stable even under fast and abrupt motions. Event-based cameras offer high temporal resolution, power efficiency, and high dynamic range. However, the properties of event-based data are very different compared to standard intensity images, and simple extensions of corner detection methods designed for these images do not perform well on event-based data. We first introduce an efficient way to compute a time surface that is invariant to the speed of the objects. We then show that we can train a Random Forest to recognize events generated by a moving corner from our time surface. Random Forests are also extremely efficient, and therefore a good choice to deal with the high capture frequency of event-based cameras ---our implementation processes up to 1.6Mev/s on a single CPU. Thanks to our time surface formulation and this learning approach, our method is significantly more robust to abrupt changes of direction of the corners compared to previous ones. Our method also naturally assigns a confidence score for the corners, which can be useful for postprocessing. Moreover, we introduce a high-resolution dataset suitable for quantitative evaluation and comparison of corner detection methods for event-based cameras. We call our approach SILC, for Speed Invariant Learned Corners, and compare it to the state-of-the-art with extensive experiments, showing better performance.

    * Abstract: Recent years have witnessed increasing attentions on two-sample test with diverse real applications, while this work takes one more step on the exploration of local significant differences for two-sample test. We propose the ME$_\text{MaBiD}$, an effective test for two-sample testing, and the basic idea is to exploit local information by multiple Mahalanobis kernels and introduce bi-directional hypothesis for testing. On the exploration of local significant differences, we first partition the embedding space into several rectangle regions via a new splitting criterion, which is relevant to test power and data correlation. We then explore local significant differences based on our bi-directional masked $p$-value together with the ME$_\text{MaBiD}$ test. Theoretically, we present the asymptotic distribution and lower bounds of test power for our ME$_\text{MaBiD}$ test, and control the familywise error rate on the exploration of local significant differences. We finally conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on two-sample test and the exploration of local significant differences.

    * Abstract: Due to the steadily rising amount of valuable goods in supply chains, tampering detection for parcels is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we focus on the use-case last-mile delivery, where only a single RGB image is taken and compared against a reference from an existing database to detect potential appearance changes that indicate tampering. We propose a tampering detection pipeline that utilizes keypoint detection to identify the eight corner points of a parcel. This permits applying a perspective transformation to create normalized fronto-parallel views for each visible parcel side surface. These viewpoint-invariant parcel side surface representations facilitate the identification of signs of tampering on parcels within the supply chain, since they reduce the problem to parcel side surface matching with pair-wise appearance change detection. Experiments with multiple classical and deep learning-based change detection approaches are performed on our newly collected TAMpering detection dataset for PARcels, called TAMPAR. We evaluate keypoint and change detection separately, as well as in a unified system for tampering detection. Our evaluation shows promising results for keypoint (Keypoint AP 75.76) and tampering detection (81% accuracy, F1-Score 0.83) on real images. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for tampering types, lens distortion and viewing angles is presented. Code and dataset are available at https://a-nau.github.io/tampar.

    * Abstract: The Landsat program is the longest-running Earth observation program in history, with 50+ years of data acquisition by 8 satellites. The multispectral imagery captured by sensors onboard these satellites is critical for a wide range of scientific fields. Despite the increasing popularity of deep learning and remote sensing, the majority of researchers still use decision trees and random forests for Landsat image analysis due to the prevalence of small labeled datasets and lack of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce SSL4EO-L, the first ever dataset designed for Self-Supervised Learning for Earth Observation for the Landsat family of satellites (including 3 sensors and 2 product levels) and the largest Landsat dataset in history (5M image patches). Additionally, we modernize and re-release the L7 Irish and L8 Biome cloud detection datasets, and introduce the first ML benchmark datasets for Landsats 4–5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ SR. Finally, we pre-train the first foundation models for Landsat imagery using SSL4EO-L and evaluate their performance on multiple semantic segmentation tasks. All datasets and model weights are available via the TorchGeo library, making reproducibility and experimentation easy, and enabling scientific advancements in the burgeoning field of remote sensing for a multitude of downstream applications.

    * Abstract: Timely and accurate crop type classification plays an essential role in the study of agricultural application. However, large area or cross-regional crop classification confronts huge challenges owing to dramatic phenology discrepancy among training and test regions. In this work, we propose a novel framework to address these challenges based on deep recurrent network and unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). Specifically, we firstly propose a Temporal Spatial Network (TSNet) for pixelwise crop classification, which contains stacked RNN and self-attention module to adaptively extract multi-level features from crop samples under various planting conditions. To deal with the cross-regional challenge, an unsupervised DA-based framework named Phenology Alignment Network (PAN) is proposed. PAN consists of two branches of two identical TSNet pre-trained on source domain; one branch takes source samples while the other takes target samples as input. Through aligning the hierarchical deep features extracted from two branches, the discrepancy between two regions is decreased and the pre-trained model is adapted to the target domain without using target label information. As another contribution, a time series dataset based on Sentinel-2 was annotated containing winter crop samples collected on three study sites of China. Cross-regional experiments demonstrate that TSNet shows comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods, and PAN further improves the overall accuracy by 5.62%, and macro average F1 score by 0.094 unsupervisedly.

    * Abstract: Large-scale high-resolution (HR) land-cover mapping is a vital task to survey the Earth's surface and resolve many challenges facing humanity. However it is still a non-trivial task hindered by complex ground details various landforms and the scarcity of accurate training labels over a wide-span geographic area. In this paper we propose an efficient weakly supervised framework (Paraformer) to guide large-scale HR land-cover mapping with easy-access historical land-cover data of low resolution (LR). Specifically existing land-cover mapping approaches reveal the dominance of CNNs in preserving local ground details but still suffer from insufficient global modeling in various landforms. Therefore we design a parallel CNN-Transformer feature extractor in Paraformer consisting of a downsampling-free CNN branch and a Transformer branch to jointly capture local and global contextual information. Besides facing the spatial mismatch of training data a pseudo-label-assisted training (PLAT) module is adopted to reasonably refine LR labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation of HR images. Experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of Paraformer over other state-of-the-art methods for automatically updating HR land-cover maps from LR historical labels.

    * Abstract: Time-of-flight (TOF) depth cameras provide robust depth inference at low power requirements in a wide variety of consumer and industrial applications. These cameras reconstruct a single depth frame from a given set of infrared (IR) frames captured over a very short exposure period. Operating in this mode the camera essentially forgets all information previously captured - and performs depth inference from scratch for every frame. We challenge this practice and propose using previously captured information when inferring depth. An inherent problem we have to address is camera motion over this longer period of collecting observations. We derive a probabilistic framework combining a simple but robust model of camera and object motion, together with an observation model. This combination allows us to integrate information over multiple frames while remaining robust to rapid changes. Operating the camera in this manner has implications in terms of both computational efficiency and how information should be captured. We address these two issues and demonstrate a realtime TOF system with robust temporal integration that improves depth accuracy over strong baseline methods including adaptive spatio-temporal filters.

    * Abstract: Conventional SLAM methods which work very well in typical above-water situations, are based on detecting keypoints that are tracked between images, from which egomotion and the 3D structure of the scene are estimated. However, in underwater environments with marine snow -- small particles of organic matter which are carried by ocean currents throughout the water column -- keypoint detectors are prone to detect the marine snow particles. As the vast majority of SLAM front ends are sensitive against outliers, and the marine snow acts as severe "motion noise", failure of the regular egomotion and 3D structure estimation is expected. For this reason, we investigate the structure and appearance of marine snow and developed two schemes which classify keypoints into "marine snow" or "clean" based on either the image patches obtained from usual keypoint detectors or the descriptors computed from these patches. This way the subsequent SLAM pipeline is protected against 'false' keypoints. We quantitatively evaluate the performance of our marine snow classifier on both real underwater video scenes as well as on simulated underwater footage that contains marine snow. These simulated image sequences have been created by extracting real marine snow elements from real underwater footage, and subsequently overlaying these on "clean" underwater videos. Qualitative evaluation is also done on a nightime road sequence with snowfall to demonstrate applicability in other areas of autonomy. We furthermore evaluate the performance and the effect of marine snow detection & suppression by integrating the snow suppression module in a full SLAM pipeline based on the pySLAM system.

    * Abstract: Research in self-supervised learning (SSL) with natural images has progressed rapidly in recent years and is now increasingly being applied to and benchmarked with datasets containing remotely sensed imagery. A common benchmark case is to evaluate SSL pre-trained model embeddings on datasets of remotely sensed imagery with small patch sizes e.g. 32 x 32 pixels whereas standard SSL pre-training takes place with larger patch sizes e.g. 224 x 224. Furthermore pre-training methods tend to use different image normalization preprocessing steps depending on the dataset. In this paper we show across seven satellite and aerial imagery datasets of varying resolution that by simply following the preprocessing steps used in pre-training (precisely image sizing and normalization methods) one can achieve significant performance improvements when evaluating the extracted features on downstream tasks -- an important detail overlooked in previous work in this space. We show that by following these steps ImageNet pre-training remains a competitive baseline for satellite imagery based transfer learning tasks -- for example we find that these steps give +32.28 to overall accuracy on the So2Sat random split dataset and +11.16 on the EuroSAT dataset. Finally we report comprehensive benchmark results with a variety of simple baseline methods for each of the seven datasets forming an initial benchmark suite for remote sensing imagery.

    * Abstract: Large scale datasets created from user labels or openly available data have become crucial to provide training data for large scale learning algorithms. While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised learning techniques. In this paper we propose an iterative learning method that extracts the useful information from a large scale change detection dataset generated from open vector data to train a fully convolutional network which surpasses the performance obtained by naive supervised learning. We also propose the guided anisotropic diffusion algorithm, which improves semantic segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge preserving filtering, and is used in conjunction with the iterative training method to improve results.

    * Abstract: Shadows, motion parallax, and occlusions pose significant challenges to vision tasks in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) including object identification and tracking. Although there are many successful shadow detection approaches that work well in indoor scenes, close range outdoor scenes, and spaceborne satellite images, the methods tend to fail in intermediate altitude aerial WAMI. We propose an automatic shadow mask estimation approach for supervision without manual labeling to provide a large amount of training data for learning-based aerial shadow extraction. Analytical ground-truth shadow masks are generated using 3D point clouds combined with known solar angles. FSDNet, a deep network for shadow detection, is evaluated on aerial imagery. Preliminary results indicate that training using automated shadow mask supervision improves performance, and opens the door for developing new deep architectures for shadow detection and enhancement in WAMI.
