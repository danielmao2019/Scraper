    * Abstract: The Visual Object Tracking challenge VOT2019 is the seventh annual tracker benchmarking activity organized by the VOT initiative. Results of 81 trackers are presented; many are state-of-the-art trackers published at major computer vision conferences or in journals in the recent years. The evaluation included the standard VOT and other popular methodologies for short-term tracking analysis as well as the standard VOT methodology for long-term tracking analysis. The VOT2019 challenge was composed of five challenges focusing on different tracking domains: (i) VOTST2019 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB, (ii) VOT-RT2019 challenge focused on "real-time" shortterm tracking in RGB, (iii) VOT-LT2019 focused on longterm tracking namely coping with target disappearance and reappearance. Two new challenges have been introduced: (iv) VOT-RGBT2019 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB and thermal imagery and (v) VOT-RGBD2019 challenge focused on long-term tracking in RGB and depth imagery. The VOT-ST2019, VOT-RT2019 and VOT-LT2019 datasets were refreshed while new datasets were introduced for VOT-RGBT2019 and VOT-RGBD2019. The VOT toolkit has been updated to support both standard shortterm, long-term tracking and tracking with multi-channel imagery. Performance of the tested trackers typically by far exceeds standard baselines. The source code for most of the trackers is publicly available from the VOT page. The dataset, the evaluation kit and the results are publicly available at the challenge website.

    * Abstract: Phenotypic assessment of plants for herbicide discovery is a complex visual task and involves the comparison of a non-treated plant to those treated with herbicides to assign a phytotoxicity score. It is often subjective and difficult to quantify by human observers. Employing novel computer vision approaches using neural networks in order to be non-subjective and truly quantitative offers advantages for data quality, leading to improved decision making. In this paper we present a deep learning approach for comparative plant assessment using Siamese neural networks, an architecture that takes pairs of images as inputs, and we overcome the hurdles of data collection by proposing a novel pseudo-labelling approach for combining different pairs of input images. We demonstrate a high level of accuracy with this method, comparable to human scoring, and present a series of experiments grading Amaranthus retroflexus weeds using our trained model.

    * Abstract: Recently, change detection (CD) of remote sensing images have achieved great progress with the advances of deep learning. However, current methods generally deliver incomplete CD regions and irregular CD boundaries due to the limited representation ability of the extracted visual features. To relieve these issues, in this work we propose a novel learning framework named Fully Transformer Network (FTN) for remote sensing image CD, which improves the feature extraction from a global view and combines multi-level visual features in a pyramid manner. More specifically, the proposed framework first utilizes the advantages of Transformers in long-range dependency modeling. It can help to learn more discriminative global-level features and obtain complete CD regions. Then, we introduce a pyramid structure to aggregate multi-level visual features from Transformers for feature enhancement. The pyramid structure grafted with a Progressive Attention Module (PAM) can improve the feature representation ability with additional interdependencies through channel attentions. Finally, to better train the framework, we utilize the deeply-supervised learning with multiple boundaryaware loss functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on four public CD benchmarks.

    * Abstract: Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) that leverage the adversarial training framework for image restoration and enhancement have significantly improved the processed images' sharpness. Surprisingly, although these DCNNs produced crispier images than other methods visually, they may get a lower quality score when popular measures are employed for evaluating them. Therefore it is necessary to develop a quantitative metric to reflect their performances, which is well-aligned with the perceived quality of an image. Famous quantitative metrics such as Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), The structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and Perceptual Index (PI) are not well-correlated with the mean opinion score (MOS) for an image, especially for the neural networks trained with adversarial loss functions. This paper has proposed a convolutional neural network using an extension architecture of the traditional Siamese network so-called Siamese-Difference neural network. We have equipped this architecture with the spatial and channel-wise attention mechanism to increase our method's performance. Finally, we employed an auxiliary loss function to train our model. The suggested additional cost function surrogates ranking loss to increase Spearman's rank correlation coefficient while it is differentiable concerning the neural network parameters. Our method achieved superior performance in NTIRE 2021 Perceptual Image Quality Assessment Challenge. The implementations of our proposed method are publicly available.

    * Abstract: With the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) intrusion, anti-UAV techniques are becoming increasingly demanding. Object tracking, especially in thermal infrared (TIR) videos, though provides a promising solution, struggles with challenges like small scale and fast movement that commonly occur in anti-UAV scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose a simple yet effective spatio-temporal attention based Siamese network, dubbed SiamSTA, to track UAV robustly by performing reliable local tracking and wide-range re-detection alternatively. Concretely, tracking is carried out by posing spatial and temporal constraints on generating candidate proposals within local neighborhoods, hence eliminating background distractors to better perceive small targets. Complementarily, in case of target lost from local regions due to fast movement, a three-stage re-detection mechanism is introduced to re-detect targets from a global view by exploiting valuable motion cues through a correlation filter based on change detection. Finally, a state-aware switching policy is adopted to adaptively integrate local tracking and global re-detection and take their complementary strengths for robust tracking. Extensive experiments on the 1st and 2nd anti-UAV datasets well demonstrate the superiority of SiamSTA over other competing counterparts. Notably, SiamSTA is the foundation of the 1st-place winning entry in the 2nd Anti-UAV Challenge.

    * Abstract: Deep learning methods have demonstrated encouraging performance on open-air visual object tracking (VOT) benchmarks, however, their strength remains unexplored on underwater video sequences due to the lack of challenging underwater VOT benchmarks. Apart from the challenges of open-air tracking, videos captured in underwater environments pose additional challenges for tracking such as low visibility, poor video quality, distortions in sharpness and contrast, reflections from suspended particles, and non-uniform lighting. We propose a new underwater tracking benchmark dataset (UTB180) consisting of 180 sequences to facilitate the development of underwater deep trackers. The sequences in UTB180 are selected from both underwater natural and online sources with over 58,000 annotated frames. Video-level attributes are also provided to facilitate the development of robust trackers for specific challenges. We benchmark 15 existing pre-trained State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) trackers on UTB180 and compare their performance on another publicly available underwater benchmark. The trackers consistently perform worse on UTB180 showing that it poses more challenging scenarios. Moreover, we show that fine-tuning five high-quality SOTA trackers on UTB180 still does not sufficiently boost their tracking performance. Our experiments show that the UTB180 sequences pose a major burden on the SOTA trackers as compared to their open-air tracking performance. The performance gap reveals the need for a dedicated end-to-end underwater deep tracker that takes into account the inherent properties of underwater environments. We believe that our proposed dataset will be of great value to the tracking community in advancing the state of the art in underwater VOT. Our dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.

    * Abstract: Detecting change through multi-image, multi-date remote sensing is essential to developing an understanding of global conditions. Despite recent advancements in remote sensing realized through deep learning, novel methods for accurate multi-image change detection remain unrealized. Recently, several promising methods have been proposed to address this topic, but a paucity of publicly available data limits the methods that can be assessed. In particular, there exists limited work on categorizing the nature and status of change across an observation period. This paper introduces the first labeled dataset available for such a task. We present an open-source change detection dataset, termed QFabric, with 450,000 change polygons annotated across 504 locations in 100 different cities covering a wide range of geographies and urban fabrics. QFabric is a temporal multi-task dataset with 6 change types and 9 change status classes. The geography and environment metadata around each polygon provides context that can be leveraged to build robust deep neural networks. We apply multiple benchmarks on our dataset for change detection, change type and status classification tasks. Project page: https://sagarverma.github.io/qfabric

    * Abstract: The frequency and intensity of natural disasters (i.e. wildfires, storms, floods) has increased over recent decades. Extreme weather can often be linked to climate change, and human population expansion and urbanization have led to a growing risk. In particular floods due to large amounts of rainfall are of rising severity and are causing loss of life, destruction of buildings and infrastructure, erosion of arable land, and environmental hazards around the world. Expanding urbanization along rivers and creeks often includes opening flood plains for building construction and river straightening and dredging speeding up the flow of water. In a flood event, rapid response is essential which requires knowledge which buildings are susceptible to flooding and which roads are still accessible. To this aim, SpaceNet 8 is the first remote sensing machine learning training dataset combining building footprint detection, road network extraction, and flood detection covering 850km 2, including 32k buildings and 1,300km roads of which 13% and 15% are flooded, respectively.

    * Abstract: Autonomous anomaly detection is a fundamental step in visual surveillance systems, and so we have witnessed great progress in the form of various promising algorithms. Nonetheless, majority of prior algorithms assume static surveillance cameras that severely restricts the coverage of the system unless the number of cameras is exponentially increased, consequently increasing both the installation and monitoring costs. In the current work we propose an anomaly detection system based on mobile surveillance cameras, i.e., moving robot which continuously navigates a target area. We compare the newly acquired test images with a database of normal images using geo-tags. For anomaly detection, a Siamese network is trained which analyses two input images for anomalies while ignoring the viewpoint differences. Further, our system is capable of updating the normal images database with human collaboration. Finally, we propose a new dataset that is captured by repeated visits of the robot over a target area. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for anomaly detection using mobile surveillance robots.

    * Abstract: We present a novel approach for inspecting variable data prints (VDP) with an ultra-low false alarm rate (0.005%) and potential applicability to other real-world problems. The system is based on a comparison between two images: a reference image and an image captured by low-cost scanners. The comparison task is challenging as low-cost imaging systems create artifacts that may erroneously be classified as true (genuine) defects. To address this challenge we introduce two new fusion methods, for change detection applications, which are both fast and efficient. The first is an early fusion method that combines the two input images into a single pseudo-color image. The second, called Change-Detection Single Shot Detector (CD-SSD) leverages the SSD by fusing features in the middle of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning-based approach with a large dataset from real-world printing scenarios. Finally, we evaluate our models on a different domain of aerial imagery change detection (AICD). Our best method clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on this dataset.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a prior-less method for tracking and clustering an unknown number of human faces and maintaining their individual identities in unconstrained videos. The key challenge is to accurately track faces with partial occlusion and drastic appearance changes in multiple shots resulting from significant variations of makeup, facial expression, head pose and illumination. To address this challenge, we propose a new multi-face tracking and re-identification algorithm, which provides high accuracy in face association in the entire video with automatic cluster number generation, and is robust to outliers. We develop a co-occurrence model of multiple body parts to seamlessly create face tracklets, and recursively link tracklets to construct a graph for extracting clusters. A Gaussian Process model is introduced to compensate the deep feature insufficiency, and is further used to refine the linking results. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using a variety of challenging music videos and newly introduced body-worn camera videos. The proposed method obtains significant improvements over the state of the art [51], while relying less on handling video-specific prior information to achieve high performance.

    * Abstract: Background/Foreground separation is a fundamental and challenging task of many computer vision applications. The F-measure performance of state-of-the-art models is limited due to the lack of fine details in the predicted output (i.e., the foreground object) and the limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a background/foreground separation model based on a transformer that has a higher learning capacity than the convolutional neural networks. The model is trained using self-supervised learning to leverage the limited data and learn a strong object representation that is invariant to changes. The proposed method, dubbed TransBlast, reformulates the background/foreground separation problem in self-supervised learning using the augmented subspace loss function. The augmented subspace loss function consists of two components: 1) the cross-entropy loss function and 2) the subspace that depends on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The proposed model is evaluated using three benchmarks, namely CDNet, DAVIS, and SegTrackV2. The performance of TransBlast outperforms state-of-the-art background/foreground separation models in terms of F-measure.

    * Abstract: In computer vision, Image Difference Captioning (IDC) is crucial for accurately describing variations between closely related images. Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the models robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.

    * Abstract: Self-supervised learning aims to learn image feature representations without the usage of manually annotated labels. It is often used as a precursor step to obtain useful initial network weights which contribute to faster convergence and superior performance of downstream tasks. While self-supervision allows one to reduce the domain gap between supervised and unsupervised learning without the usage of labels, the self-supervised objective still requires a strong inductive bias to downstream tasks for effective transfer learning. In this work, we present our material and texture based self-supervision method named MATTER (MATerial and TExture Representation Learning), which is inspired by classical material and texture methods. Material and texture can effectively describe any surface, including its tactile properties, color, and specularity. By extension, effective representation of material and texture can describe other semantic classes strongly associated with said material and texture. MATTER leverages multi-temporal, spatially aligned remote sensing imagery over unchanged regions to learn invariance to illumination and viewing angle as a mechanism to achieve consistency of material and texture representation. We show that our self-supervision pre-training method allows for up to 24.22% and 6.33% performance increase in unsupervised and fine-tuned setups, and up to 76% faster convergence on change detection, land cover classification, and semantic segmentation tasks.

    * Abstract: Large scale datasets created from user labels or openly available data have become crucial to provide training data for large scale learning algorithms. While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised learning techniques. In this paper we propose an iterative learning method that extracts the useful information from a large scale change detection dataset generated from open vector data to train a fully convolutional network which surpasses the performance obtained by naive supervised learning. We also propose the guided anisotropic diffusion algorithm, which improves semantic segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge preserving filtering, and is used in conjunction with the iterative training method to improve results.

    * Abstract: Existing change captioning studies have mainly focused on a single change. However, detecting and describing multiple changed parts in image pairs is essential for enhancing adaptability to complex scenarios. We solve the above issues from three aspects: (i) We propose a simulation-based multi-change captioning dataset; (ii) We benchmark existing state-of-the-art methods of single change captioning on multi-change captioning; (iii) We further propose Multi-Change Captioning transformers (MCCFormers) that identify change regions by densely correlating different regions in image pairs and dynamically determines the related change regions with words in sentences. The proposed method obtained the highest scores on four conventional change captioning evaluation metrics for multi-change captioning. Additionally, our proposed method can separate attention maps for each change and performs well with respect to change localization. Moreover, the proposed framework outperformed the previous state-of-the-art methods on an existing change captioning benchmark, CLEVR-Change, by a large margin (+6.1 on BLEU-4 and +9.7 on CIDEr scores), indicating its general ability in change captioning tasks. The code and dataset are available at the project page.

    * Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of Earth's surface is a mission of multi-temporal remote sensing image analysis, significantly promoted by deep vision models with its fuel---labeled multi-temporal images. However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present a scalable multi-temporal remote sensing change data generator via generative modeling, which is cheap and automatic, alleviating these problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time. We consider the stochastic change process as a probabilistic semantic state transition, namely generative probabilistic change model (GPCM), which decouples the complex simulation problem into two more trackable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present the change generator (Changen), a GAN-based GPCM, enabling controllable object change data generation, including customizable object property, and change event. The extensive experiments suggest that our Changen has superior generation capability, and the change detectors with Changen pre-training exhibit excellent transferability to real-world change datasets.

    * Abstract: Synthetic datasets, recognized for their cost effectiveness, play a pivotal role in advancing computer vision tasks and techniques. However, when it comes to remote sensing image processing, the creation of synthetic datasets becomes challenging due to the demand for larger-scale and more diverse 3D models. This complexity is compounded by the difficulties associated with real remote sensing datasets, including limited data acquisition and high annotation costs, which amplifies the need for high-quality synthetic alternatives. To address this, we present SyntheWorld, a synthetic dataset unparalleled in quality, diversity, and scale. It includes 40,000 images with submeter-level pixels and fine-grained land cover annotations of eight categories, and it also provides 40,000 pairs of bitemporal image pairs with building change annotations for building change detection. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets to verify the effectiveness of SyntheWorld and to investigate the conditions under which our synthetic data yield advantages.

    * Abstract: Maps are an increasingly important tool in our daily lives, yet their rich semantic content still largely depends on manual input. Motivated by the broad availability of geo-tagged street-view images, we propose a new task aiming to make the map update process more proactive. We focus on automatically detecting changes of Points of Interest (POIs), specifically stores or shops of any kind, based on visual input. Faced with the lack of an appropriate benchmark, we build and release a large dataset, captured in two large shopping centers, that comprises 33K geo-localized images and 578 POIs. We then design a generic approach that compares two image sets captured in the same venue at different times and outputs POI changes as a ranked list of map locations. In contrast to logo or franchise recognition approaches, our system does not depend on an external franchise database. It is instead inspired by recent deep metric learning approaches that learn a similarity function fit to the task at hand. We compare various loss functions to learn a metric aligned with the POI change detection goal, and report promising results.

    * Abstract: Earth observation is a fundamental tool for monitoring the evolution of land use in specific areas of interest. Observing and precisely defining change, in this context, requires both time-series data and pixel-wise segmentations. To that end, we propose the DynamicEarthNet dataset that consists of daily, multi-spectral satellite observations of 75 selected areas of interest distributed over the globe with imagery from Planet Labs. These observations are paired with pixel-wise monthly semantic segmentation labels of 7 land use and land cover (LULC) classes. DynamicEarthNet is the first dataset that provides this unique combination of daily measurements and high-quality labels. In our experiments, we compare several established baselines that either utilize the daily observations as additional training data (semi-supervised learning) or multiple observations at once (spatio-temporal learning) as a point of reference for future research. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric SCS that addresses the specific challenges associated with time-series semantic change segmentation.

    * Abstract: Background subtraction (BGS) aims to extract all moving objects in the video frames to obtain binary foreground segmentation masks. Deep learning has been widely used in this field. Compared with supervised-based BGS methods, unsupervised methods have better generalization. However, previous unsupervised deep learning BGS algorithms perform poorly in sophisticated scenarios such as shadows or night lights, and they cannot detect objects outside the pre-defined categories. In this work, we propose an unsupervised BGS algorithm based on zero-shot object detection called Zero-shot Background Subtraction ZBS. The proposed method fully utilizes the advantages of zero-shot object detection to build the open-vocabulary instance-level background model. Based on it, the foreground can be effectively extracted by comparing the detection results of new frames with the background model. ZBS performs well for sophisticated scenarios, and it has rich and extensible categories. Furthermore, our method can easily generalize to other tasks, such as abandoned object detection in unseen environments. We experimentally show that ZBS surpasses state-of-the-art unsupervised BGS methods by 4.70% F-Measure on the CDnet 2014 dataset. The code is released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/ZBS.

    * Abstract: Reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) has the potential to build bridges across spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing images. However existing RefSR methods are limited by the faithfulness of content reconstruction and the effectiveness of texture transfer in large scaling factors. Conditional diffusion models have opened up new opportunities for generating realistic high-resolution images but effectively utilizing reference images within these models remains an area for further exploration. Furthermore content fidelity is difficult to guarantee in areas without relevant reference information. To solve these issues we propose a change-aware diffusion model named Ref-Diff for RefSR using the land cover change priors to guide the denoising process explicitly. Specifically we inject the priors into the denoising model to improve the utilization of reference information in unchanged areas and regulate the reconstruction of semantically relevant content in changed areas. With this powerful guidance we decouple the semantics-guided denoising and reference texture-guided denoising processes to improve the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art RefSR methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

    * Abstract: In the expansive domain of computer vision a myriad of pre-trained models are at our disposal. However most of these models are designed for natural RGB images and prove inadequate for spectral remote sensing (RS) images. Spectral RS images have two main traits: (1) multiple bands capturing diverse feature information (2) spatial alignment and consistent spectral sequencing within the spatial-spectral dimension. In this paper we introduce Spatial-SpectralMAE (S2MAE) a specialized pre-trained architecture for spectral RS imagery. S2MAE employs a 3D transformer for masked autoencoder modeling integrating learnable spectral-spatial embeddings with a 90% masking ratio. The model efficiently captures local spectral consistency and spatial invariance using compact cube tokens demonstrating versatility to diverse input characteristics. This adaptability facilitates progressive pretraining on extensive spectral datasets. The effectiveness of S2MAE is validated through continuous pretraining on two sizable datasets totaling over a million training images. The pre-trained model is subsequently applied to three distinct downstream tasks with in-depth ablation studies conducted to emphasize its efficacy.

    * Abstract: We investigate a procedure for rapidly adding calibrated vehicle visible-near infrared (VNIR) paint signatures to an existing hyperspectral simulator - The Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) model - to create more diversity in simulated urban scenes. The DIRSIG model can produce synthetic hyperspectral imagery with user-specified geometry, atmospheric conditions, and ground target spectra. To render an object pixel's spectral signature, DIRSIG uses a large database of reflectance curves for the corresponding object material and a bidirectional reflectance model to introduce s due to orientation and surface structure. However, this database contains only a few spectral curves for vehicle paints and generates new paint signatures by combining these curves internally. In this paper we demonstrate a method to rapidly generate multiple paint spectra, flying a drone carrying a pushbroom hyperspectral camera to image a university parking lot. We then process the images to convert them from the digital count space to spectral reflectance without the need of calibration panels in the scene, and port the paint signatures into DIRSIG for successful integration into the newly rendered sets of synthetic VNIR hyperspectral scenes.

    * Abstract: For high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, bitemporal supervised learning always dominates change detection using many pairwise labeled bitemporal images. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to pairwise label large-scale bitemporal HSR remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose single-temporal supervised learning (STAR) for change detection from a new perspective of exploiting object changes in unpaired images as supervisory signals. STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector only using unpaired labeled images and generalize to real-world bitemporal images. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep semantic segmentation architecture by the ChangeMixin module. The comprehensive experimental results show that ChangeStar outperforms the baseline with a large margin under single-temporal supervision and achieves superior performance under bitemporal supervision.

    * Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for a variety of applications such as urban planning, disaster management, and climate research. However, existing methods for identifying semantically changed areas overlook the availability of semantic information in the form of existing maps describing features of the earth's surface. In this paper, we leverage this information for change detection in bi-temporal images. We show that the simple integration of the additional information via concatenation of latent representations suffices to significantly outperform state-of-the-art change detection methods. Motivated by this observation, we propose the new task of Conditional Change Detection, where pre-change semantic information is used as input next to bi-temporal images. To fully exploit the extra information, we propose MapFormer, a novel architecture based on a multi-modal feature fusion module that allows for feature processing conditioned on the available semantic information. We further employ a supervised, cross-modal contrastive loss to guide the learning of visual representations. Our approach outperforms existing change detection methods by an absolute 11.7% and 18.4% in terms of binary change IoU on DynamicEarthNet and HRSCD, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to the quality of the pre-change semantic information and the absence pre-change imagery.

Given two images of the same scene, being able to automatically detect the changes in them has practical applications in a variety of domains. In this paper, we tackle the change detection problem with the goal of detecting "object-level" changes in an image pair despite differences in their viewpoint and illumination. To this end, we make the following four contributions: (i) we propose a scalable methodology for obtaining a large-scale change detection training dataset by leveraging existing object segmentation benchmarks; (ii) we introduce a co-attention based novel architecture that is able to implicitly determine correspondences between an image pair and find changes in the form of bounding box predictions; (iii) we contribute four evaluation datasets that cover a variety of domains and transformations, including synthetic image changes, real surveillance images of a 3D scene, and synthetic 3D scenes with camera motion; (iv) we evaluate our model on these four datasets and demonstrate zero-shot and beyond training transformation generalization.

    * Abstract: Standard RGB-D trackers treat the target as a 2D structure, which makes modelling appearance changes related even to out-of-plane rotation challenging. This limitation is addressed by the proposed long-term RGB-D tracker called OTR - Object Tracking by Reconstruction. OTR performs online 3D target reconstruction to facilitate robust learning of a set of view-specific discriminative correlation filters (DCFs). The 3D reconstruction supports two performance- enhancing features: (i) generation of an accurate spatial support for constrained DCF learning from its 2D projection and (ii) point-cloud based estimation of 3D pose change for selection and storage of view-specific DCFs which robustly localize the target after out-of-view rotation or heavy occlusion. Extensive evaluation on the Princeton RGB-D tracking and STC Benchmarks shows OTR outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

    * Abstract: Anomaly detection in video is a challenging computer vision problem. Due to the lack of anomalous events at training time, anomaly detection requires the design of learning methods without full supervision. In this paper, we approach anomalous event detection in video through self-supervised and multi-task learning at the object level. We first utilize a pre-trained detector to detect objects. Then, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to produce discriminative anomaly-specific information by jointly learning multiple proxy tasks: three self-supervised and one based on knowledge distillation. The self-supervised tasks are: (i) discrimination of forward/backward moving objects (arrow of time), (ii) discrimination of objects in consecutive/intermittent frames (motion irregularity) and (iii) reconstruction of object-specific appearance information. The knowledge distillation task takes into account both classification and detection information, generating large prediction discrepancies between teacher and student models when anomalies occur. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach anomalous event detection in video as a multi-task learning problem, integrating multiple self-supervised and knowledge distillation proxy tasks in a single architecture. Our lightweight architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks: Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped2. Additionally, we perform an ablation study demonstrating the importance of integrating self-supervised learning and normality-specific distillation in a multi-task learning setting.

    * Abstract: We tackle the challenging task of image change captioning. The goal is to describe the subtle difference between two very similar images by generating a sentence caption. While the recent methods mainly focus on proposing new model architectures for this problem, we instead focus on an alternative training scheme. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning, we formulate a training scheme that uses an auxiliary task to improve the training of the change captioning network. We argue that the task of composed query image retrieval is a natural choice as the auxiliary task. Given two almost similar images as the input, the primary network generates a caption describing the fine change between those two images. Next, the auxiliary network is provided with the generated caption and one of those two images. It then tries to pick the second image among a set of candidates. This forces the primary network to generate detailed and precise captions via having an extra supervision loss by the auxiliary network. Furthermore, we propose a new scheme for selecting a negative set of candidates for the retrieval task that can effectively improve the performance. We show that the proposed training strategy performs well on the task of change captioning on benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Accurate change detection enables a wide range of tasks in visual surveillance, anomaly detection and mobile robotics. However, contemporary change detection approaches assume an ideal matching between the current and stored scenes, whereas only coarse matching is possible in real-world scenarios. Thus, contemporary approaches fail to show the reported performance in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose SimSaC. SimSaC concurrently conducts scene flow estimation and change detection and is able to detect changes with imperfect matches. To train SimSaC without additional manual labeling, we propose a training scheme with random geometric transformations and the cut-paste method. Moreover, we design an evaluation protocol which reflects performance in real-world settings. In designing the protocol, we collect a test benchmark dataset, which we claim as another contribution. Our comprehensive experiments verify that SimSaC displays robust performance even given imperfect matches and the performance margin compared to contemporary approaches is huge.

Among the successful approaches for anomaly detection, a distinguished category of methods relies on predicting masked information (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and leveraging the reconstruction error with respect to the masked information as an abnormality score. Different from related methods, we propose to integrate the reconstruction-based functionality into a novel self-supervised predictive architectural building block. The proposed self-supervised block is generic and can easily be incorporated into various state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Our block starts with a convolutional layer with dilated filters, where the center area of the receptive field is masked. The resulting activation maps are passed through a channel attention module. Our block is equipped with a loss that minimizes the reconstruction error with respect to the masked area in the receptive field. We demonstrate the generality of our block by integrating it into several state-of-the-art frameworks for anomaly detection on image and video, providing empirical evidence that shows considerable performance improvements on MVTec AD, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech. We release our code as open source at: https://github.com/ristea/sspcab.

    * Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn generalizable representations for image, text, audio, video, etc., by reconstructing masked input data from tokens of the visible data. Current MAE approaches for videos rely on random patch, tube, or frame based masking strategies to select these tokens. This paper proposes AdaMAE, an adaptive masking strategy for MAEs that is end-to-end trainable. Our adaptive masking strategy samples visible tokens based on the semantic context using an auxiliary sampling network. This network estimates a categorical distribution over spacetime-patch tokens. The tokens that increase the expected reconstruction error are rewarded and selected as visible tokens, motivated by the policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning. We show that AdaMAE samples more tokens from the high spatiotemporal information regions, thereby allowing us to mask 95% of tokens, resulting in lower memory requirements and faster pre-training. We conduct ablation studies on the Something-Something v2 (SSv2) dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive sampling approach and report state-of-the-art results of 70.0% and 81.7% in top-1 accuracy on SSv2 and Kinetics-400 action classification datasets with a ViT-Base backbone and 800 pre-training epochs.

    * Abstract: Self-supervised learning in vision--language processing (VLP) exploits semantic alignment between imaging and text modalities. Prior work in biomedical VLP has mostly relied on the alignment of single image and report pairs even though clinical notes commonly refer to prior images. This does not only introduce poor alignment between the modalities but also a missed opportunity to exploit rich self-supervision through existing temporal content in the data. In this work, we explicitly account for prior images and reports when available during both training and fine-tuning. Our approach, named BioViL-T, uses a CNN--Transformer hybrid multi-image encoder trained jointly with a text model. It is designed to be versatile to arising challenges such as pose variations and missing input images across time. The resulting model excels on downstream tasks both in single- and multi-image setups, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on (I) progression classification, (II) phrase grounding, and (III) report generation, whilst offering consistent improvements on disease classification and sentence-similarity tasks. We release a novel multi-modal temporal benchmark dataset, CXR-T, to quantify the quality of vision--language representations in terms of temporal semantics. Our experimental results show the significant advantages of incorporating prior images and reports to make most use of the data.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel category agnostic model for visual rearrangement task which can help an embodied agent to physically recover the shuffled scene configuration without any category concepts to the goal configuration. Previous methods usually follow a similar architecture completing the rearrangement task by aligning the scene changes of the goal and shuffled configuration according to the semantic scene graphs. However constructing scene graphs requires the inference of category labels which not only causes the accuracy drop of the entire task but also limits the application in real world scenario. In this paper we delve deep into the essence of visual rearrangement task and focus on the two most essential issues scene change detection and scene change matching. We utilize the movement and the protrusion of point cloud to accurately identify the scene changes and match these changes depending on the similarity of category agnostic appearance feature. Moreover to assist the agent to explore the environment more efficiently and comprehensively we propose a closer-aligned-retrace exploration policy aiming to observe more details of the scene at a closer distance. We conduct extensive experiments on AI2THOR Rearrangement Challenge based on RoomR dataset and a new multi-room multi-instance dataset MrMiR collected by us. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    * Authors: Keval Doshi, Yasin Yilmaz
    * Abstract: Most video anomaly detection approaches are based on data-intensive end-to-end trained neural networks, which extract spatiotemporal features from videos. The extracted feature representations in such approaches are not interpretable, which prevents the automatic identification of anomaly cause. To this end, we propose a novel framework which can explain the detected anomalous event in a surveillance video. In addition to monitoring objects independently, we also monitor the interactions between them to detect anomalous events and explain their root causes. Specifically, we demonstrate that the scene graphs obtained by monitoring the object interactions provide an interpretation for the context of the anomaly while performing competitively with respect to the recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the proposed interpretable method enables cross-domain adaptability (i.e., transfer learning in another surveillance scene), which is not feasible for most existing end-to-end methods due to the lack of sufficient labeled training data for every surveillance scene. The quick and reliable detection performance of the proposed method is evaluated both theoretically (through an asymptotic optimality proof) and empirically on the popular benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Monitoring Earth activity using data collected from multiple satellite imaging platforms in a unified way is a significant challenge, especially with large variability in image resolution, spectral bands, and revisit rates. Further, the availability of sensor data varies across time as new platforms are launched. In this work, we introduce an adaptable framework and network architecture capable of predicting on subsets of the available platforms, bands, or temporal ranges it was trained on. Our system, called WATCH, is highly general and can be applied to a variety of geospatial tasks. In this work, we analyze the performance of WATCH using the recent IARPA SMART public dataset and metrics. We focus primarily on the problem of broad area search for heavy construction sites. Experiments validate the robustness of WATCH during inference to limited sensor availability, as well the the ability to alter inference-time spatial or temporal sampling. WATCH is open source and available for use on this or other remote sensing problems. Code and model weights are available at: https://gitlab.kitware.com/computer-vision/geowatch

    * Abstract: Due to the steadily rising amount of valuable goods in supply chains, tampering detection for parcels is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we focus on the use-case last-mile delivery, where only a single RGB image is taken and compared against a reference from an existing database to detect potential appearance changes that indicate tampering. We propose a tampering detection pipeline that utilizes keypoint detection to identify the eight corner points of a parcel. This permits applying a perspective transformation to create normalized fronto-parallel views for each visible parcel side surface. These viewpoint-invariant parcel side surface representations facilitate the identification of signs of tampering on parcels within the supply chain, since they reduce the problem to parcel side surface matching with pair-wise appearance change detection. Experiments with multiple classical and deep learning-based change detection approaches are performed on our newly collected TAMpering detection dataset for PARcels, called TAMPAR. We evaluate keypoint and change detection separately, as well as in a unified system for tampering detection. Our evaluation shows promising results for keypoint (Keypoint AP 75.76) and tampering detection (81% accuracy, F1-Score 0.83) on real images. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for tampering types, lens distortion and viewing angles is presented. Code and dataset are available at https://a-nau.github.io/tampar.

    * Abstract: Satellite imagery is increasingly available, high resolution, and temporally detailed. Changes in spatio-temporal datasets such as satellite images are particularly interesting as they reveal the many events and forces that shape our world. However, finding such interesting and meaningful change events from the vast data is challenging. In this paper, we present new datasets for such change events that include semantically meaningful events like road construction. Instead of manually annotating the very large corpus of satellite images, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach that takes a large spatio-temporal dataset from satellite images and finds interesting change events. To evaluate the meaningfulness on these datasets we create 2 benchmarks namely CaiRoad and CalFire which capture the events of road construction and forest fires. These new benchmarks can be used to evaluate semantic retrieval/classification performance. We explore these benchmarks qualitatively and quantitatively by using several methods and show that these new datasets are indeed challenging for many existing methods.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel multimodal video benchmark - the Perception Test - to evaluate the perception and reasoning skills of pre-trained multimodal models (e.g. Flamingo, BEiT-3, or GPT-4). Compared to existing benchmarks that focus on computational tasks (e.g. classification, detection or tracking), the Perception Test focuses on skills (Memory, Abstraction, Physics, Semantics) and types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual) across video, audio, and text modalities, to provide a comprehensive and efficient evaluation tool. The benchmark probes pre-trained models for their transfer capabilities, in a zero-shot / few-shot or limited finetuning regime. For these purposes, the Perception Test introduces 11.6k real-world videos, 23s average length, designed to show perceptually interesting situations, filmed by around 100 participants worldwide. The videos are densely annotated with six types of labels (multiple-choice and grounded video question-answers, object and point tracks, temporal action and sound segments), enabling both language and non-language evaluations. The fine-tuning and validation splits of the benchmark are publicly available (CC-BY license), in addition to a challenge server with a held-out test split. Human baseline results compared to state-of-the-art video QA models show a significant gap in performance (91.4% vs 45.8%), suggesting that there is significant room for improvement in multimodal video understanding.Dataset, baselines code, and challenge server are available at https://github.com/deepmind/perception_test

    * Abstract: The objective of this paper is motion segmentation -- discovering and segmenting the moving objects in a video. This is a much studied area with numerous careful, and sometimes complex, approaches and training schemes including: self-supervised learning, learning from synthetic datasets, object-centric representations, amodal representations, and many more. Our interest in this paper is to determine if the Segment Anything model (SAM) can contribute to this task. We investigate two models for combining SAM with optical flow that harness the segmentation power of SAM with the ability of flow to discover and group moving objects. In the first model, we adapt SAM to take optical flow, rather than RGB, as an input. In the second, SAM takes RGB as an input, and flow is used as a segmentation prompt. These surprisingly simple methods, without any further modifications, outperform all previous approaches by a considerable margin in both single and multi-object benchmarks. We also extend these frame-level segmentations to sequence-level segmentations that maintain object identity. Again, this simple model achieves outstanding performance across multiple moving object segmentation benchmarks.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for rare event detection from an image pair with class-imbalanced datasets. A straightforward approach for event detection tasks is to train a detection network from a large-scale dataset in an end-to-end manner. However, in many applications such as building change detection on satellite images, few positive samples are available for the training. Moreover, an image pair of scenes contains many trivial events, such as in illumination changes or background motions. These many trivial events and the class imbalance problem lead to false alarms for rare event detection. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel method to learn disentangled representations from only low-cost negative samples. The proposed method disentangles the different aspects in a pair of observations: variant and invariant factors that represent trivial events and image contents, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the quantitative evaluations on four change detection datasets, and the qualitative analysis shows that the proposed method can acquire the representations that disentangle rare events from trivial ones.

    * Abstract: Moving object segmentation in videos (MOS) is a highly demanding task for security-based applications like automated outdoor video surveillance. Most of the existing techniques proposed for MOS are highly depend on fine-tuning a model on the first frame(s) of test sequence or complicated training procedure, which leads to limited practical serviceability of the algorithm. In this paper, the inherent correlation learning-based edge extraction mechanism (EEM) and dense residual block (DRB) are proposed for the discriminative foreground representation. The multi-scale EEM module provides the efficient foreground edge related information (with the help of encoder) to the decoder through skip connection at subsequent scale. Further, the response of the optical flow encoder stream and the last EEM module are embedded in the bridge network. The bridge network comprises of multi-scale residual blocks with dense connections to learn the effective and efficient foreground relevant features. Finally, to generate accurate and consistent foreground object maps, a decoder block is proposed with skip connections from respective multi-scale EEM module feature maps and the subsequent down-sampled response of previous frame output. Specifically, the proposed network does not require any pre-trained models or fine-tuning of the parameters with the initial frame(s) of the test video. The performance of the proposed network is evaluated with different configurations like disjoint, cross-data, and global training-testing techniques. The ablation study is conducted to analyse each model of the proposed network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a comprehensive analysis on four benchmark video datasets is conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for MOS.

    * Abstract: Satellite imagery analytics have numerous human development and disaster response applications, particularly when time series methods are involved. For example, quantifying population statistics is fundamental to 67 of the 231 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators, but the World Bank estimates that over 100 countries currently lack effective Civil Registration systems. To help address this deficit and develop novel computer vision methods for time series data, we present the Multi-Temporal Urban Development SpaceNet (MUDS, also known as SpaceNet 7) dataset. This open source dataset consists of medium resolution (4.0m) satellite imagery mosaics, which includes 24 images (one per month) covering >100 unique geographies, and comprises >40,000 km2 of imagery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints therein, totaling over 11M individual annotations. Each building is assigned a unique identifier (i.e. address), which permits tracking of individual objects over time. Label fidelity exceeds image resolution; this "omniscient labeling" is a unique feature of the dataset, and enables surprisingly precise algorithmic models to be crafted. We demonstrate methods to track building footprint construction (or demolition) over time, thereby directly assessing urbanization. Performance is measured with the newly developed SpaceNet Change and Object Tracking (SCOT) metric, which quantifies both object tracking as well as change detection. We demonstrate that despite the moderate resolution of the data, we are able to track individual building identifiers over time.

    * Abstract: We describe an unsupervised method to detect and segment portions of images of live scenes that, at some point in time, are seen moving as a coherent whole, which we refer to as objects. Our method first partitions the motion field by minimizing the mutual information between segments. Then, it uses the segments to learn object models that can be used for detection in a static image. Static and dynamic models are represented by deep neural networks trained jointly in a bootstrapping strategy, which enables extrapolation to previously unseen objects. While the training process requires motion, the resulting object segmentation network can be used on either static images or videos at inference time. As the volume of seen videos grows, more and more objects are seen moving, priming their detection, which then serves as a regularizer for new objects, turning our method into unsupervised continual learning to segment objects. Our models are compared to the state of the art in both video object segmentation and salient object detection. In the six benchmark datasets tested, our models compare favorably even to those using pixel-level supervision, despite requiring no manual annotation.

    * Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse a registered high-resolution panchromatic image (PAN) with a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) to generate an enhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial resolution. Existing pansharpening approaches neglect using an attention mechanism to transfer HR texture features from PAN to LR-HSI features, resulting in spatial and spectral distortions. In this paper, we present a novel attention mechanism for pansharpening called HyperTransformer, in which features of LR-HSI and PAN are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer, respectively. HyperTransformer consists of three main modules, namely two separate feature extractors for PAN and HSI, a multi-head feature soft attention module, and a spatial-spectral feature fusion module. Such a network improves both spatial and spectral quality measures of the pansharpened HSI by learning cross-feature space dependencies and long-range details of PAN and LR-HSI. Furthermore, HyperTransformer can be utilized across multiple spatial scales at the backbone for obtaining improved performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that HyperTransformer achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on both spatial and spectral quality measures.

    * Abstract: While classic video anomaly detection (VAD) requires labeled normal videos for training, emerging unsupervised VAD (UVAD) aims to discover anomalies directly from fully unlabeled videos. However, existing UVAD methods still rely on shallow models to perform detection or initialization, and they are evidently inferior to classic VAD methods. This paper proposes a full deep neural network (DNN) based solution that can realize highly effective UVAD. First, we, for the first time, point out that deep reconstruction can be surprisingly effective for UVAD, which inspires us to unveil a property named "normality advantage", i.e., normal events will enjoy lower reconstruction loss when DNN learns to reconstruct unlabeled videos. With this property, we propose Localization based Reconstruction (LBR) as a strong UVAD baseline and a solid foundation of our solution. Second, we propose a novel self-paced refinement (SPR) scheme, which is synthesized into LBR to conduct UVAD. Unlike ordinary self-paced learning that injects more samples in an easy-to-hard manner, the proposed SPR scheme gradually drops samples so that suspicious anomalies can be removed from the learning process. In this way, SPR consolidates normality advantage and enables better UVAD in a more proactive way. Finally, we further design a variant solution that explicitly takes the motion cues into account. The solution evidently enhances the UVAD performance, and it sometimes even surpasses the best classic VAD methods. Experiments show that our solution not only significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods by a wide margin (5% to 9% AUROC), but also enables UVAD to catch up with the mainstream performance of classic VAD.

    * Abstract: Skeletonization is an important process of extracting the medial axis of the object shape while maintaining the original geometric and topological properties. Some recent studies have demonstrated that deep learning-based segmentation models can extract the main skeleton from objects more robustly. However, we find that the skeleton extracted by a vanilla segmentation process is always discontinuous and not accurate enough. In this paper, we propose a general cascade deep learning pipeline that achieves competitive performance only using a simple U-shape network. The semantic information contained in the shapes is limited, so we introduce a ConvNet with multi-source input and multi-task output, CAMION for short, on top of the basic shape-to-skeleton network. With the multi-source inputs, CAMION can converge faster than using only binary shapes; and with the introduction of multi-task learning, relevant and suitable auxiliary tasks (e.g., feature point detection and contour extraction) bring considerable gains for the extraction of skeleton. Our code used in Pixel SkelNetOn - CVPR 2022 challenge will be released at https://github.com/likyoo/CAMION-CVPRW2022.

    * Abstract: Few-shot and cross-domain land use scene classification methods propose solutions to classify unseen classes or unseen visual distributions, but are hardly applicable to real-world situations due to restrictive assumptions. Few-shot methods involve episodic training on restrictive training subsets with small feature extractors, while cross-domain methods are only applied to common classes. The underlying challenge remains open: can we accurately classify new scenes on new datasets? In this paper, we propose a new framework for few-shot, cross-domain classification. Our retrieval-inspired approach exploits the interrelations in both the training and testing data to output class labels using compact descriptors. Results show that our method can accurately produce land-use predictions on unseen datasets and unseen classes, going beyond the traditional few-shot or cross-domain formulation, and allowing cross-dataset training.

    * Abstract: To train the change detector, bi-temporal images taken at different times in the same area are used. However, collecting labeled bi-temporal images is expensive and time consuming. To solve this problem, various unsupervised change detection methods have been proposed, but they still require unlabeled bi-temporal images. In this paper, we propose unsupervised change detection based on image reconstruction loss using only unlabeled single temporal single image. The image reconstruction model is trained to reconstruct the original source image by receiving the source image and the photometrically transformed source image as a pair. During inference, the model receives bi-temporal images as the input, and tries to reconstruct one of the inputs. The changed region between bi-temporal images shows high reconstruction loss. Our change detector showed significant performance in various change detection benchmark datasets even though only a single temporal single source image was used. The code and trained models will be publicly available for reproducibility.

    * Abstract: Learning with large-scale unlabeled data has become a powerful tool for pre-training Visual Transformers (VTs). However, prior works tend to overlook that, in real-world scenarios, the input data may be corrupted and unreliable. Pre-training VTs on such corrupted data can be challenging, especially when we pre-train via the masked autoencoding approach, where both the inputs and masked "ground truth" targets can potentially be unreliable in this case. To address this limitation, we introduce the Token Boosting Module (TBM) as a plug-and-play component for VTs that effectively allows the VT to learn to extract clean and robust features during masked autoencoding pre-training. We provide theoretical analysis to show how TBM improves model pre-training with more robust and generalizable representations, thus benefiting downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze TBM's effectiveness, and results on four corrupted datasets demonstrate that TBM consistently improves performance on downstream tasks.

    * Abstract: Automatic remote sensing tools can help inform many large-scale challenges such as disaster management, climate change, etc. While a vast amount of spatio-temporal satellite image data is readily available, most of it remains unlabelled. Without labels, this data is not very useful for supervised learning algorithms. Self-supervised learning instead provides a way to learn effective representations for various downstream tasks without labels. In this work, we leverage characteristics unique to satellite images to learn better self-supervised features. Specifically, we use the temporal signal to contrast images with long-term and short-term differences, and we leverage the fact that satellite images do not change frequently. Using these characteristics, we formulate a new loss contrastive loss called Change-Aware Contrastive (CACo) Loss. Further, we also present a novel method of sampling different geographical regions. We show that leveraging these properties leads to better performance on diverse downstream tasks. For example, we see a 6.5% relative improvement for semantic segmentation and an 8.5% relative improvement for change detection over the best-performing baseline with our method.

    * Authors: Lihe Yang, Lei Qi, Litong Feng, Wayne Zhang, Yinghuan Shi
    * Abstract: In this work, we revisit the weak-to-strong consistency framework, popularized by FixMatch from semi-supervised classification, where the prediction of a weakly perturbed image serves as supervision for its strongly perturbed version. Intriguingly, we observe that such a simple pipeline already achieves competitive results against recent advanced works, when transferred to our segmentation scenario. Its success heavily relies on the manual design of strong data augmentations, however, which may be limited and inadequate to explore a broader perturbation space. Motivated by this, we propose an auxiliary feature perturbation stream as a supplement, leading to an expanded perturbation space. On the other, to sufficiently probe original image-level augmentations, we present a dual-stream perturbation technique, enabling two strong views to be simultaneously guided by a common weak view. Consequently, our overall Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations approach (UniMatch) surpasses all existing methods significantly across all evaluation protocols on the Pascal, Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks. Its superiority is also demonstrated in remote sensing interpretation and medical image analysis. We hope our reproduced FixMatch and our results can inspire more future works.

    * Abstract: In recent years, the success of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP has led to their increased usage in various computer vision tasks. These models enable zero-shot inference through carefully crafted instructional text prompts without task-specific supervision. However, the potential of VLMs for generalization tasks in remote sensing (RS) has not been fully realized. To address this research gap, we propose a novel image-conditioned prompt learning strategy called the Visual Attention Parameterized Prompts Learning Network (APPLeNet). APPLeNet emphasizes the importance of multi-scale feature learning in RS scene classification and disentangles visual style and content primitives for domain generalization tasks. To achieve this, APPLeNet combines visual content features obtained from different layers of the vision encoder and style properties obtained from feature statistics of domain-specific batches. An attention-driven injection module is further introduced to generate visual tokens from this information. We also introduce an anti-correlation regularizer to ensure discrimination among the token embeddings, as this visual information is combined with the textual tokens. To validate APPLeNet, we curated four available RS benchmarks and introduced experimental protocols and datasets for three domain generalization tasks. Our results consistently outperform the relevant literature.

    * Abstract: Visible-infrared (RGB-IR) image fusion has shown great potentials in object detection based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However the weakly misalignment problem between multimodal image pairs limits its performance in object detection. Most existing methods often ignore the modality gap and emphasize a strict alignment resulting in an upper bound of alignment quality and an increase of implementation costs. To address these challenges we propose a novel method named Offset-guided Adaptive Feature Alignment (OAFA) which could adaptively adjust the relative positions between multimodal features. Considering the impact of modality gap on the cross-modality spatial matching a Cross-modality Spatial Offset Modeling (CSOM) module is designed to establish a common subspace to estimate the precise feature-level offsets. Then an Offset-guided Deformable Alignment and Fusion (ODAF) module is utilized to implicitly capture optimal fusion positions for detection task rather than conducting a strict alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in the UAVs-based object detection task but also shows strong robustness to the weakly misalignment problem.

    * Abstract: We propose an efficient abnormal event detection model based on a lightweight masked auto-encoder (AE) applied at the video frame level. The novelty of the proposed model is threefold. First we introduce an approach to weight tokens based on motion gradients thus shifting the focus from the static background scene to the foreground objects. Second we integrate a teacher decoder and a student decoder into our architecture leveraging the discrepancy between the outputs given by the two decoders to improve anomaly detection. Third we generate synthetic abnormal events to augment the training videos and task the masked AE model to jointly reconstruct the original frames (without anomalies) and the corresponding pixel-level anomaly maps. Our design leads to an efficient and effective model as demonstrated by the extensive experiments carried out on four benchmarks: Avenue ShanghaiTech UBnormal and UCSD Ped2. The empirical results show that our model achieves an excellent trade-off between speed and accuracy obtaining competitive AUC scores while processing 1655 FPS. Hence our model is between 8 and 70 times faster than competing methods. We also conduct an ablation study to justify our design. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/aed-mae.

    * Abstract: As an important pillar of underwater intelligence Marine Animal Segmentation (MAS) involves segmenting animals within marine environments. Previous methods don't excel in extracting long-range contextual features and overlook the connectivity between discrete pixels. Recently Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a universal framework for general segmentation tasks. Unfortunately trained with natural images SAM does not obtain the prior knowledge from marine images. In addition the single-position prompt of SAM is very insufficient for prior guidance. To address these issues we propose a novel feature learning framework named Dual-SAM for high-performance MAS. To this end we first introduce a dual structure with SAM's paradigm to enhance feature learning of marine images. Then we propose a Multi-level Coupled Prompt (MCP) strategy to instruct comprehensive underwater prior information and enhance the multi-level features of SAM's encoder with adapters. Subsequently we design a Dilated Fusion Attention Module (DFAM) to progressively integrate multi-level features from SAM's encoder. Finally instead of directly predicting the masks of marine animals we propose a Criss-Cross Connectivity Prediction (C3P) paradigm to capture the inter-connectivity between discrete pixels. With dual decoders it generates pseudo-labels and achieves mutual supervision for complementary feature representations resulting in considerable improvements over previous techniques. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on five widely-used MAS datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Drchip61/Dual SAM.

    * Abstract: Since large number of high-quality remote sensing images are readily accessible exploiting the corpus of images with less manual annotation draws increasing attention. Self-supervised models acquire general feature representations by formulating a pretext task that generates pseudo-labels for massive unlabeled data to provide supervision for training. While prior studies have explored multiple self-supervised learning techniques in remote sensing domain pretext tasks based on local-global view alignment remain underexplored despite achieving state-of-the-art results on natural imagery. Inspired by DINO [6] which employs an effective representation learning structure with knowledge distillation based on global-local view alignment we formulate two pretext tasks for self-supervised learning on remote sensing imagery (SSLRS). Using these tasks we explore the effectiveness of positive temporal contrast as well as multi-sized views on SSLRS. We extend DINO and propose DINO-MC which uses local views of various sized crops instead of a single fixed size in order to alleviate the limited variation in object size observed in remote sensing imagery. Our experiments demonstrate that even when pre-trained on only 10% of the dataset DINO-MC performs on par or better than existing state-of-the-art SSLRS methods on multiple remote sensing tasks while using less computational resources.

    * Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos has been recently gaining attention. Even though the performance of state-of-the-art methods on publicly available data sets has been competitive, they demand a massive amount of training data. Also, they lack a concrete approach for continuously updating the trained model once new data is available. Furthermore, online decision making is an important but mostly neglected factor in this domain. Motivated by these research gaps, we propose an online anomaly detection method for surveillance videos using transfer learning and any-shot learning, which in turn significantly reduces the training complexity and provides a mechanism which can detect anomalies using only a few labeled nominal examples. Our proposed algorithm leverages the feature extraction power of neural network-based models for transfer learning, and the any-shot learning capability of statistical detection methods.

    * Abstract: Remote sensing and automatic earth monitoring are key to solve global-scale challenges such as disaster prevention, land use monitoring, or tackling climate change. Although there exist vast amounts of remote sensing data, most of it remains unlabeled and thus inaccessible for supervised learning algorithms. Transfer learning approaches can reduce the data requirements of deep learning algorithms. However, most of these methods are pre-trained on ImageNet and their generalization to remote sensing imagery is not guaranteed due to the domain gap. In this work, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), an effective pipeline to leverage unlabeled data for in-domain pre-training of remote sensing representations. The SeCo pipeline is composed of two parts. First, a principled procedure to gather large-scale, unlabeled and uncurated remote sensing datasets containing images from multiple Earth locations at different timestamps. Second, a self-supervised algorithm that takes advantage of time and position invariance to learn transferable representations for remote sensing applications. We empirically show that models trained with SeCo achieve better performance than their ImageNet pre-trained counterparts and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on multiple downstream tasks. The datasets and models in SeCo will be made public to facilitate transfer learning and enable rapid progress in remote sensing applications.

    * Abstract: Understanding the visual world from the perspective of humans (egocentric) has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Egocentric videos exhibit high scene complexity and irregular motion flows compared to typical video understanding tasks. With the egocentric domain in mind, we address the problem of self-supervised, class-agnostic object detection, which aims to locate all objects in a given view, regardless of category, without any annotations or pre-training weights. Our method, self-supervised object Detection from Egocentric VIdeos (DEVI), generalizes appearance-based methods to learn features that are category-specific and invariant to viewing angles and illumination conditions from highly ambiguous environments in an end-to-end manner. Our approach leverages typical human behavior and its egocentric perception to sample diverse views of the same objects for our multi-view and scale-regression loss functions. With our learned cluster residual module, we are able to effectively describe multi-category patches for better complex scene understanding. DEVI provides a boost in performance on recent egocentric datasets, with performance gains up to 4.11% AP50, 0.11% AR1, 1.32% AR10, and 5.03% AR100, while significantly reducing model complexity. We also demonstrate competitive performance on out-of-domain datasets without additional training or fine-tuning.

    * Abstract: Geospatial technologies are becoming increasingly essential in our world for a wide range of applications, including agriculture, urban planning, and disaster response. To help improve the applicability and performance of deep learning models on these geospatial tasks, various works have begun investigating foundation models for this domain. Researchers have explored two prominent approaches for introducing such models in geospatial applications, but both have drawbacks in terms of limited performance benefit or prohibitive training cost. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel paradigm for building highly effective geospatial foundation models with minimal resource cost and carbon impact. We first construct a compact yet diverse dataset from multiple sources to promote feature diversity, which we term GeoPile. Then, we investigate the potential of continual pretraining from large-scale ImageNet-22k models and propose a multi-objective continual pretraining paradigm, which leverages the strong representations of ImageNet while simultaneously providing the freedom to learn valuable in-domain features. Our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial pretraining methods in an extensive evaluation on seven downstream datasets covering various tasks such as change detection, classification, multi-label classification, semantic segmentation, and super-resolution.

    * Abstract: The goal of this paper is to detect what has changed, if anything, between two "in the wild" images of the same 3D scene acquired from different camera positions and at different temporal instances. The open-set nature of this problem, occlusions/dis-occlusions due to the shift in viewpoint, and the lack of suitable training datasets, presents substantial challenges in devising a solution. To address this problem, we contribute a change detection model that is trained entirely on synthetic data and is class-agnostic, yet it is performant out-of-the-box on real world images without requiring fine-tuning. Our solution entails a "register and difference" approach that leverages self-supervised frozen embeddings and feature differences, which allows the model to generalise to a wide variety of scenes and domains. The model is able to operate directly on two RGB images, without requiring access to ground truth camera intrinsics, extrinsics, depth maps, point clouds, or additional before-after images. Finally, we collect and release a new evaluation dataset consisting of real-world image pairs with human-annotated differences and demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

    * Abstract: Background subtraction is a basic task in computer vision and video processing often applied as a pre-processing step for object tracking, people recognition, etc. Recently, a number of successful background-subtraction algorithms have been proposed, however nearly all of the top-performing ones are supervised. Crucially, their success relies upon the availability of some annotated frames of the test video during training. Consequently, their performance on completely "unseen" videos is undocumented in the literature. In this work, we propose a new, supervised, background-subtraction algorithm for unseen videos (BSUV-Net) based on a fully-convolutional neural network. The input to our network consists of the current frame and two background frames captured at different time scales along with their semantic segmentation maps. In order to reduce the chance of overfitting, we also introduce a new data-augmentation technique which mitigates the impact of illumination difference between the background frames and the current frame. On the CDNet-2014 dataset, BSUV-Net outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on unseen videos in terms of several metrics including F-measure, recall and precision.

    * Abstract: Moving object segmentation (MOS) in different practical scenarios like weather degraded, dynamic background, etc. videos is a challenging and high demanding task for various computer vision applications. Existing supervised approaches achieve remarkable performance with complicated training or extensive fine-tuning or inappropriate training-testing data distribution. Also, the generalized effect of existing works with completely unseen data is difficult to identify. In this work, the recurrent feature sharing based generative adversarial network is proposed with unseen video analysis. The proposed network comprises of dilated convolution to extract the spatial features at multiple scales. Along with the temporally sampled multiple frames, previous frame output is considered as input to the network. As the motion is very minute between the two consecutive frames, the previous frame decoder features are shared with encoder features recurrently for current frame foreground segmentation. This recurrent feature sharing of different layers helps the encoder network to learn the hierarchical interactions between the motion and appearance based features. Also, the learning of the proposed network is concentrated in different ways, like disjoint and global training-testing for MOS. An extensive experimental analysis of the proposed network is carried out on two benchmark video datasets with seen and unseen MOS video. Qualitative and quantitative experimental study shows that the proposed network outperforms the existing methods.

    * Abstract: For change detection in remote sensing, constructing a training dataset for deep learning models is quite difficult due to the requirements of bi-temporal supervision. To overcome this issue, single-temporal supervision which treats change labels as the difference of two semantic masks has been proposed. This novel method trains a change detector using two spatially unrelated images with corresponding semantic labels. However, training with unpaired dataset shows not enough performance compared with other methods based on bi-temporal supervision. We suspect this phenomenon caused by ignorance of meaningful information in the actual bi-temporal pairs.In this paper, we emphasize that the change originates from the source image and show that manipulating the source image as an after-image is crucial to the performance of change detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a large gap than existing methods.

    * Abstract: Semantic segmentation in large-scale aerial images is an extremely challenging task. On one hand, the limited ground truth, as compared to the vast area the images cover, greatly hinders the development of supervised representation learning. On the other hand, the large footprint from remote sensing raises new challenges for semantic segmentation. In addition, the complex and ever changing image acquisition conditions further complicate the problem where domain shifting commonly occurs. In this paper, we exploit self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) methodologies for semantic segmentation in aerial imagery. In addition to performing CL at the feature level as most practices do, we add another level of contrastive learning, at the semantic level, taking advantage of the segmentation output from the downstream task. Further, we embed local mutual information in the semantic-level CL to enforce local consistency. This has largely enhanced the representation power at each pixel and improved the generalization capacity of the trained model. We refer to the proposed approach as multi-level contrastive learning with local consistency (mCL-LC). The experimental results on different benchmarks indicate that the proposed mCL-LC exhibits superior performance as compared to other state-of-the-art contrastive learning frameworks for the semantic segmentation task. mCL-LC also carries better generalization capacity especially when domain shifting exists.

    * Abstract: Scene change detection (SCD) is a critical task for various applications, such as visual surveillance, anomaly detection, and mobile robotics. Recently, supervised methods for SCD have been developed for urban and indoor environments where input image pairs are typically unaligned due to differences in camera viewpoints. However, supervised SCD methods require pixel-wise change labels and alignment labels for the target domain, which can be both time-consuming and expensive to collect. To tackle this issue, we design an unsupervised loss with regularization methods based on the feature-metric alignment of input image pairs. The proposed unsupervised loss enables the SCD model to jointly learn the flow and the change maps on the target domain. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning method based on a distillation loss for the robustness of the SCD model. The proposed learning method is based on the student-teacher structure and incorporates the unsupervised loss of the unlabeled target data and the supervised loss of the labeled synthetic data. Our method achieves considerable performance improvement on the target domain through the proposed unsupervised and distillation loss, using only 10% of the target training dataset without using any labels of the target data.

    * Abstract: Identifying changes in a pair of 3D aerial LiDAR point clouds, obtained during two distinct time periods over the same geographic region presents a significant challenge due to the disparities in spatial coverage and the presence of noise in the acquisition system. The most commonly used approaches to detecting changes in point clouds are based on supervised methods which necessitate extensive labelled data often unavailable in real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised approach that comprises two components: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous shape reconstruction and a Gaussian Mixture Model for categorising changes. INR offers a grid-agnostic representation for encoding bi-temporal point clouds, with unmatched spatial support that can be regularised to enhance high-frequency details and reduce noise. The reconstructions at each timestamp are compared at arbitrary spatial scales, leading to a significant increase in detection capabilities. We apply our method to a benchmark dataset comprising simulated LiDAR point clouds for urban sprawling. This dataset encompasses diverse challenging scenarios, varying in resolutions, input modalities and noise levels. This enables a comprehensive multi-scenario evaluation, comparing our method with the current state-of-the-art approach. We outperform the previous methods by a margin of 10% in the intersection over union metric. In addition, we put our techniques to practical use by applying them in a real-world scenario to identify instances of illicit excavation of archaeological sites and validate our results by comparing them with findings from field experts.

    * Abstract: Learning in small sample regimes is among the most remarkable features of the human perceptual system. This ability is related to robustness to transformations, which is acquired through visual experience in the form of weak- or self-supervision during development. We explore the idea of allowing artificial systems to learn representations of visual stimuli through weak supervision prior to downstream supervised tasks. We introduce a novel loss function for representation learning using unlabeled image sets and video sequences, and experimentally demonstrate that these representations support one-shot learning and reduce the sample complexity of multiple recognition tasks. We establish the existence of a trade-off between the sizes of weakly supervised, automatically obtained from video sequences, and fully supervised data sets. Our results suggest that equivalence sets other than class labels, which are abundant in unlabeled visual experience, can be used for self-supervised learning of semantically relevant image embeddings.

    * Abstract: Recent self-supervised advances in medical computer vision exploit the global and local anatomical self-similarity for pretraining prior to downstream tasks such as segmentation. However, current methods assume i.i.d. image acquisition, which is invalid in clinical study designs where follow-up longitudinal scans track subject-specific temporal changes. Further, existing self-supervised methods for medically-relevant image-to-image architectures exploit only spatial or temporal self-similarity and do so via a loss applied only at a single image-scale, with naive multi-scale spatiotemporal extensions collapsing to degenerate solutions. To these ends, this paper makes two contributions: (1) It presents a local and multi-scale spatiotemporal representation learning method for image-to-image architectures trained on longitudinal images. It exploits the spatiotemporal self-similarity of learned multi-scale intra-subject image features for pretraining and develops several feature-wise regularizations that avoid degenerate representations; (2) During finetuning, it proposes a surprisingly simple self-supervised segmentation consistency regularization to exploit intra-subject correlation. Benchmarked across various segmentation tasks, the proposed framework outperforms both well-tuned randomly-initialized baselines and current self-supervised techniques designed for both i.i.d. and longitudinal datasets. These improvements are demonstrated across both longitudinal neurodegenerative adult MRI and developing infant brain MRI and yield both higher performance and longitudinal consistency.

    * Abstract: A vital and rapidly growing application, remote sensing offers vast yet sparsely labeled, spatially aligned multimodal data; this makes self-supervised learning algorithms invaluable. We present CROMA: a framework that combines contrastive and reconstruction self-supervised objectives to learn rich unimodal and multimodal representations. Our method separately encodes masked-out multispectral optical and synthetic aperture radar samples—aligned in space and time—and performs cross-modal contrastive learning. Another encoder fuses these sensors, producing joint multimodal encodings that are used to predict the masked patches via a lightweight decoder. We show that these objectives are complementary when leveraged on spatially aligned multimodal data. We also introduce X- and 2D-ALiBi, which spatially biases our cross- and self-attention matrices. These strategies improve representations and allow our models to effectively extrapolate to images up to $17.6\times$ larger at test-time. CROMA outperforms the current SoTA multispectral model, evaluated on: four classification benchmarks—finetuning (avg.$\uparrow$ 1.8%), linear (avg.$\uparrow$ 2.4%) and nonlinear (avg.$\uparrow$ 1.4%) probing, $k$NN classification (avg.$\uparrow$ 3.5%), and $K$-means clustering (avg.$\uparrow$ 8.4%); and three segmentation benchmarks (avg.$\uparrow$ 6.4%). CROMA’s rich, optionally multimodal representations can be widely leveraged across remote sensing applications.

    * Abstract: Equivariance has gained strong interest as a desirable network property that inherently ensures robust generalization. However, when dealing with complex systems such as articulated objects or multi-object scenes, effectively capturing inter-part transformations poses a challenge, as it becomes entangled with the overall structure and local transformations. The interdependence of part assignment and per-part group action necessitates a novel equivariance formulation that allows for their co-evolution. In this paper, we present Banana, a Banach fixed-point network for equivariant segmentation with inter-part equivariance by construction. Our key insight is to iteratively solve a fixed-point problem, where point-part assignment labels and per-part SE(3)-equivariance co-evolve simultaneously. We provide theoretical derivations of both per-step equivariance and global convergence, which induces an equivariant final convergent state. Our formulation naturally provides a strict definition of inter-part equivariance that generalizes to unseen inter-part configurations. Through experiments conducted on both articulated objects and multi-object scans, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving strong generalization under inter-part transformations, even when confronted with substantial changes in pointcloud geometry and topology.

    * Abstract: The Landsat program is the longest-running Earth observation program in history, with 50+ years of data acquisition by 8 satellites. The multispectral imagery captured by sensors onboard these satellites is critical for a wide range of scientific fields. Despite the increasing popularity of deep learning and remote sensing, the majority of researchers still use decision trees and random forests for Landsat image analysis due to the prevalence of small labeled datasets and lack of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce SSL4EO-L, the first ever dataset designed for Self-Supervised Learning for Earth Observation for the Landsat family of satellites (including 3 sensors and 2 product levels) and the largest Landsat dataset in history (5M image patches). Additionally, we modernize and re-release the L7 Irish and L8 Biome cloud detection datasets, and introduce the first ML benchmark datasets for Landsats 4–5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ SR. Finally, we pre-train the first foundation models for Landsat imagery using SSL4EO-L and evaluate their performance on multiple semantic segmentation tasks. All datasets and model weights are available via the TorchGeo library, making reproducibility and experimentation easy, and enabling scientific advancements in the burgeoning field of remote sensing for a multitude of downstream applications.
