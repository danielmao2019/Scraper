    * Title: A Prior-Less Method for Multi-Face Tracking in Unconstrained Videos
    * Year: `2018`
    * Authors: Chung-Ching Lin, Ying Hung
    * Abstract: This paper presents a prior-less method for tracking and clustering an unknown number of human faces and maintaining their individual identities in unconstrained videos. The key challenge is to accurately track faces with partial occlusion and drastic appearance changes in multiple shots resulting from significant variations of makeup, facial expression, head pose and illumination. To address this challenge, we propose a new multi-face tracking and re-identification algorithm, which provides high accuracy in face association in the entire video with automatic cluster number generation, and is robust to outliers. We develop a co-occurrence model of multiple body parts to seamlessly create face tracklets, and recursively link tracklets to construct a graph for extracting clusters. A Gaussian Process model is introduced to compensate the deep feature insufficiency, and is further used to refine the linking results. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using a variety of challenging music videos and newly introduced body-worn camera videos. The proposed method obtains significant improvements over the state of the art [51], while relying less on handling video-specific prior information to achieve high performance.

    * Year: `2022`
    * Authors: Peri Akiva, Matthew Purri, Matthew Leotta
    * Abstract: Self-supervised learning aims to learn image feature representations without the usage of manually annotated labels. It is often used as a precursor step to obtain useful initial network weights which contribute to faster convergence and superior performance of downstream tasks. While self-supervision allows one to reduce the domain gap between supervised and unsupervised learning without the usage of labels, the self-supervised objective still requires a strong inductive bias to downstream tasks for effective transfer learning. In this work, we present our material and texture based self-supervision method named MATTER (MATerial and TExture Representation Learning), which is inspired by classical material and texture methods. Material and texture can effectively describe any surface, including its tactile properties, color, and specularity. By extension, effective representation of material and texture can describe other semantic classes strongly associated with said material and texture. MATTER leverages multi-temporal, spatially aligned remote sensing imagery over unchanged regions to learn invariance to illumination and viewing angle as a mechanism to achieve consistency of material and texture representation. We show that our self-supervision pre-training method allows for up to 24.22% and 6.33% performance increase in unsupervised and fine-tuned setups, and up to 76% faster convergence on change detection, land cover classification, and semantic segmentation tasks.

    * Abstract: Existing change captioning studies have mainly focused on a single change. However, detecting and describing multiple changed parts in image pairs is essential for enhancing adaptability to complex scenarios. We solve the above issues from three aspects: (i) We propose a simulation-based multi-change captioning dataset; (ii) We benchmark existing state-of-the-art methods of single change captioning on multi-change captioning; (iii) We further propose Multi-Change Captioning transformers (MCCFormers) that identify change regions by densely correlating different regions in image pairs and dynamically determines the related change regions with words in sentences. The proposed method obtained the highest scores on four conventional change captioning evaluation metrics for multi-change captioning. Additionally, our proposed method can separate attention maps for each change and performs well with respect to change localization. Moreover, the proposed framework outperformed the previous state-of-the-art methods on an existing change captioning benchmark, CLEVR-Change, by a large margin (+6.1 on BLEU-4 and +9.7 on CIDEr scores), indicating its general ability in change captioning tasks.

    * Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of Earth's surface is a mission of multi-temporal remote sensing image analysis, significantly promoted by deep vision models with its fuel---labeled multi-temporal images. However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present a scalable multi-temporal remote sensing change data generator via generative modeling, which is cheap and automatic, alleviating these problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time. We consider the stochastic change process as a probabilistic semantic state transition, namely generative probabilistic change model (GPCM), which decouples the complex simulation problem into two more trackable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present the change generator (Changen), a GAN-based GPCM, enabling controllable object change data generation, including customizable object property, and change event. The extensive experiments suggest that our Changen has superior generation capability, and the change detectors with Changen pre-training exhibit excellent transferability to real-world change datasets.

    * Abstract: Earth observation is a fundamental tool for monitoring the evolution of land use in specific areas of interest. Observing and precisely defining change, in this context, requires both time-series data and pixel-wise segmentations. To that end, we propose the DynamicEarthNet dataset that consists of daily, multi-spectral satellite observations of 75 selected areas of interest distributed over the globe with imagery from Planet Labs. These observations are paired with pixel-wise monthly semantic segmentation labels of 7 land use and land cover (LULC) classes. DynamicEarthNet is the first dataset that provides this unique combination of daily measurements and high-quality labels. In our experiments, we compare several established baselines that either utilize the daily observations as additional training data (semi-supervised learning) or multiple observations at once (spatio-temporal learning) as a point of reference for future research. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric SCS that addresses the specific challenges associated with time-series semantic change segmentation.

    * Authors: Yongqi An, Xu Zhao, Tao Yu, Haiyun Guo, Chaoyang Zhao, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang
    * Abstract: Background subtraction (BGS) aims to extract all moving objects in the video frames to obtain binary foreground segmentation masks. Deep learning has been widely used in this field. Compared with supervised-based BGS methods, unsupervised methods have better generalization. However, previous unsupervised deep learning BGS algorithms perform poorly in sophisticated scenarios such as shadows or night lights, and they cannot detect objects outside the pre-defined categories. In this work, we propose an unsupervised BGS algorithm based on zero-shot object detection called Zero-shot Background Subtraction ZBS. The proposed method fully utilizes the advantages of zero-shot object detection to build the open-vocabulary instance-level background model. Based on it, the foreground can be effectively extracted by comparing the detection results of new frames with the background model. ZBS performs well for sophisticated scenarios, and it has rich and extensible categories. Furthermore, our method can easily generalize to other tasks, such as abandoned object detection in unseen environments. We experimentally show that ZBS surpasses state-of-the-art unsupervised BGS methods by 4.70% F-Measure on the CDnet 2014 dataset. The code is released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/ZBS.

    * Abstract: Reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) has the potential to build bridges across spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing images. However existing RefSR methods are limited by the faithfulness of content reconstruction and the effectiveness of texture transfer in large scaling factors. Conditional diffusion models have opened up new opportunities for generating realistic high-resolution images but effectively utilizing reference images within these models remains an area for further exploration. Furthermore content fidelity is difficult to guarantee in areas without relevant reference information. To solve these issues we propose a change-aware diffusion model named Ref-Diff for RefSR using the land cover change priors to guide the denoising process explicitly. Specifically we inject the priors into the denoising model to improve the utilization of reference information in unchanged areas and regulate the reconstruction of semantically relevant content in changed areas. With this powerful guidance we decouple the semantics-guided denoising and reference texture-guided denoising processes to improve the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art RefSR methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

    * Year: `2024`
    * Authors: Xuyang Li, Danfeng Hong, Jocelyn Chanussot
    * Abstract: In the expansive domain of computer vision a myriad of pre-trained models are at our disposal. However most of these models are designed for natural RGB images and prove inadequate for spectral remote sensing (RS) images. Spectral RS images have two main traits: (1) multiple bands capturing diverse feature information (2) spatial alignment and consistent spectral sequencing within the spatial-spectral dimension. In this paper we introduce Spatial-SpectralMAE (S2MAE) a specialized pre-trained architecture for spectral RS imagery. S2MAE employs a 3D transformer for masked autoencoder modeling integrating learnable spectral-spatial embeddings with a 90% masking ratio. The model efficiently captures local spectral consistency and spatial invariance using compact cube tokens demonstrating versatility to diverse input characteristics. This adaptability facilitates progressive pretraining on extensive spectral datasets. The effectiveness of S2MAE is validated through continuous pretraining on two sizable datasets totaling over a million training images. The pre-trained model is subsequently applied to three distinct downstream tasks with in-depth ablation studies conducted to emphasize its efficacy.

    * Abstract: For high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, bitemporal supervised learning always dominates change detection using many pairwise labeled bitemporal images. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to pairwise label large-scale bitemporal HSR remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose single-temporal supervised learning (STAR) for change detection from a new perspective of exploiting object changes in unpaired images as supervisory signals. STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector only using unpaired labeled images and generalize to real-world bitemporal images. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep semantic segmentation architecture by the ChangeMixin module. The comprehensive experimental results show that ChangeStar outperforms the baseline with a large margin under single-temporal supervision and achieves superior performance under bitemporal supervision.

    * Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for a variety of applications such as urban planning, disaster management, and climate research. However, existing methods for identifying semantically changed areas overlook the availability of semantic information in the form of existing maps describing features of the earth's surface. In this paper, we leverage this information for change detection in bi-temporal images. We show that the simple integration of the additional information via concatenation of latent representations suffices to significantly outperform state-of-the-art change detection methods. Motivated by this observation, we propose the new task of Conditional Change Detection, where pre-change semantic information is used as input next to bi-temporal images. To fully exploit the extra information, we propose MapFormer, a novel architecture based on a multi-modal feature fusion module that allows for feature processing conditioned on the available semantic information. We further employ a supervised, cross-modal contrastive loss to guide the learning of visual representations. Our approach outperforms existing change detection methods by an absolute 11.7% and 18.4% in terms of binary change IoU on DynamicEarthNet and HRSCD, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to the quality of the pre-change semantic information and the absence pre-change imagery.

    * Abstract: Maps are an increasingly important tool in our daily lives, yet their rich semantic content still largely depends on manual input. Motivated by the broad availability of geo-tagged street-view images, we propose a new task aiming to make the map update process more proactive. We focus on automatically detecting changes of Points of Interest (POIs), specifically stores or shops of any kind, based on visual input. Faced with the lack of an appropriate benchmark, we build and release a large dataset, captured in two large shopping centers, that comprises 33K geo-localized images and 578 POIs. We then design a generic approach that compares two image sets captured in the same venue at different times and outputs POI changes as a ranked list of map locations. In contrast to logo or franchise recognition approaches, our system does not depend on an external franchise database. It is instead inspired by recent deep metric learning approaches that learn a similarity function fit to the task at hand. We compare various loss functions to learn a metric aligned with the POI change detection goal, and report promising results.

    * Abstract: Anomaly detection in video is a challenging computer vision problem. Due to the lack of anomalous events at training time, anomaly detection requires the design of learning methods without full supervision. In this paper, we approach anomalous event detection in video through self-supervised and multi-task learning at the object level. We first utilize a pre-trained detector to detect objects. Then, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to produce discriminative anomaly-specific information by jointly learning multiple proxy tasks: three self-supervised and one based on knowledge distillation. The self-supervised tasks are: (i) discrimination of forward/backward moving objects (arrow of time), (ii) discrimination of objects in consecutive/intermittent frames (motion irregularity) and (iii) reconstruction of object-specific appearance information. The knowledge distillation task takes into account both classification and detection information, generating large prediction discrepancies between teacher and student models when anomalies occur. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach anomalous event detection in video as a multi-task learning problem, integrating multiple self-supervised and knowledge distillation proxy tasks in a single architecture. Our lightweight architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks: Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped2. Additionally, we perform an ablation study demonstrating the importance of integrating self-supervised learning and normality-specific distillation in a multi-task learning setting.

    * Abstract: We tackle the challenging task of image change captioning. The goal is to describe the subtle difference between two very similar images by generating a sentence caption. While the recent methods mainly focus on proposing new model architectures for this problem, we instead focus on an alternative training scheme. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning, we formulate a training scheme that uses an auxiliary task to improve the training of the change captioning network. We argue that the task of composed query image retrieval is a natural choice as the auxiliary task. Given two almost similar images as the input, the primary network generates a caption describing the fine change between those two images. Next, the auxiliary network is provided with the generated caption and one of those two images. It then tries to pick the second image among a set of candidates. This forces the primary network to generate detailed and precise captions via having an extra supervision loss by the auxiliary network. Furthermore, we propose a new scheme for selecting a negative set of candidates for the retrieval task that can effectively improve the performance. We show that the proposed training strategy performs well on the task of change captioning on benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Accurate change detection enables a wide range of tasks in visual surveillance, anomaly detection and mobile robotics. However, contemporary change detection approaches assume an ideal matching between the current and stored scenes, whereas only coarse matching is possible in real-world scenarios. Thus, contemporary approaches fail to show the reported performance in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose SimSaC. SimSaC concurrently conducts scene flow estimation and change detection and is able to detect changes with imperfect matches. To train SimSaC without additional manual labeling, we propose a training scheme with random geometric transformations and the cut-paste method. Moreover, we design an evaluation protocol which reflects performance in real-world settings. In designing the protocol, we collect a test benchmark dataset, which we claim as another contribution. Our comprehensive experiments verify that SimSaC displays robust performance even given imperfect matches and the performance margin compared to contemporary approaches is huge.

    * Abstract: Anomaly detection is commonly pursued as a one-class classification problem, where models can only learn from normal training samples, while being evaluated on both normal and abnormal test samples. Among the successful approaches for anomaly detection, a distinguished category of methods relies on predicting masked information (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and leveraging the reconstruction error with respect to the masked information as an abnormality score. Different from related methods, we propose to integrate the reconstruction-based functionality into a novel self-supervised predictive architectural building block. The proposed self-supervised block is generic and can easily be incorporated into various state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Our block starts with a convolutional layer with dilated filters, where the center area of the receptive field is masked. The resulting activation maps are passed through a channel attention module. Our block is equipped with a loss that minimizes the reconstruction error with respect to the masked area in the receptive field. We demonstrate the generality of our block by integrating it into several state-of-the-art frameworks for anomaly detection on image and video, providing empirical evidence that shows considerable performance improvements on MVTec AD, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech. We release our code as open source at: https://github.com/ristea/sspcab.

    * Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn generalizable representations for image, text, audio, video, etc., by reconstructing masked input data from tokens of the visible data. Current MAE approaches for videos rely on random patch, tube, or frame based masking strategies to select these tokens. This paper proposes AdaMAE, an adaptive masking strategy for MAEs that is end-to-end trainable. Our adaptive masking strategy samples visible tokens based on the semantic context using an auxiliary sampling network. This network estimates a categorical distribution over spacetime-patch tokens. The tokens that increase the expected reconstruction error are rewarded and selected as visible tokens, motivated by the policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning. We show that AdaMAE samples more tokens from the high spatiotemporal information regions, thereby allowing us to mask 95% of tokens, resulting in lower memory requirements and faster pre-training. We conduct ablation studies on the Something-Something v2 (SSv2) dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive sampling approach and report state-of-the-art results of 70.0% and 81.7% in top-1 accuracy on SSv2 and Kinetics-400 action classification datasets with a ViT-Base backbone and 800 pre-training epochs.

    * Abstract: Self-supervised learning in vision--language processing (VLP) exploits semantic alignment between imaging and text modalities. Prior work in biomedical VLP has mostly relied on the alignment of single image and report pairs even though clinical notes commonly refer to prior images. This does not only introduce poor alignment between the modalities but also a missed opportunity to exploit rich self-supervision through existing temporal content in the data. In this work, we explicitly account for prior images and reports when available during both training and fine-tuning. Our approach, named BioViL-T, uses a CNN--Transformer hybrid multi-image encoder trained jointly with a text model. It is designed to be versatile to arising challenges such as pose variations and missing input images across time. The resulting model excels on downstream tasks both in single- and multi-image setups, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on (I) progression classification, (II) phrase grounding, and (III) report generation, whilst offering consistent improvements on disease classification and sentence-similarity tasks. We release a novel multi-modal temporal benchmark dataset, CXR-T, to quantify the quality of vision--language representations in terms of temporal semantics. Our experimental results show the significant advantages of incorporating prior images and reports to make most use of the data.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel category agnostic model for visual rearrangement task which can help an embodied agent to physically recover the shuffled scene configuration without any category concepts to the goal configuration. Previous methods usually follow a similar architecture completing the rearrangement task by aligning the scene changes of the goal and shuffled configuration according to the semantic scene graphs. However constructing scene graphs requires the inference of category labels which not only causes the accuracy drop of the entire task but also limits the application in real world scenario. In this paper we delve deep into the essence of visual rearrangement task and focus on the two most essential issues scene change detection and scene change matching. We utilize the movement and the protrusion of point cloud to accurately identify the scene changes and match these changes depending on the similarity of category agnostic appearance feature. Moreover to assist the agent to explore the environment more efficiently and comprehensively we propose a closer-aligned-retrace exploration policy aiming to observe more details of the scene at a closer distance. We conduct extensive experiments on AI2THOR Rearrangement Challenge based on RoomR dataset and a new multi-room multi-instance dataset MrMiR collected by us. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    * Authors: Ugur Kart,  Alan Lukezic,  Matej Kristan,  Joni-Kristian Kamarainen,  Jiri Matas
    * Abstract: Standard RGB-D trackers treat the target as a 2D structure, which makes modelling appearance changes related even to out-of-plane rotation challenging. This limitation is addressed by the proposed long-term RGB-D tracker called OTR - Object Tracking by Reconstruction. OTR performs online 3D target reconstruction to facilitate robust learning of a set of view-specific discriminative correlation filters (DCFs). The 3D reconstruction supports two performance- enhancing features: (i) generation of an accurate spatial support for constrained DCF learning from its 2D projection and (ii) point-cloud based estimation of 3D pose change for selection and storage of view-specific DCFs which robustly localize the target after out-of-view rotation or heavy occlusion. Extensive evaluation on the Princeton RGB-D tracking and STC Benchmarks shows OTR outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

    * Abstract: Satellite imagery is increasingly available, high resolution, and temporally detailed. Changes in spatio-temporal datasets such as satellite images are particularly interesting as they reveal the many events and forces that shape our world. However, finding such interesting and meaningful change events from the vast data is challenging. In this paper, we present new datasets for such change events that include semantically meaningful events like road construction. Instead of manually annotating the very large corpus of satellite images, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach that takes a large spatio-temporal dataset from satellite images and finds interesting change events. To evaluate the meaningfulness on these datasets we create 2 benchmarks namely CaiRoad and CalFire which capture the events of road construction and forest fires. These new benchmarks can be used to evaluate semantic retrieval/classification performance. We explore these benchmarks qualitatively and quantitatively by using several methods and show that these new datasets are indeed challenging for many existing methods.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel multimodal video benchmark - the Perception Test - to evaluate the perception and reasoning skills of pre-trained multimodal models (e.g. Flamingo, BEiT-3, or GPT-4). Compared to existing benchmarks that focus on computational tasks (e.g. classification, detection or tracking), the Perception Test focuses on skills (Memory, Abstraction, Physics, Semantics) and types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual) across video, audio, and text modalities, to provide a comprehensive and efficient evaluation tool. The benchmark probes pre-trained models for their transfer capabilities, in a zero-shot / few-shot or limited finetuning regime. For these purposes, the Perception Test introduces 11.6k real-world videos, 23s average length, designed to show perceptually interesting situations, filmed by around 100 participants worldwide. The videos are densely annotated with six types of labels (multiple-choice and grounded video question-answers, object and point tracks, temporal action and sound segments), enabling both language and non-language evaluations. The fine-tuning and validation splits of the benchmark are publicly available (CC-BY license), in addition to a challenge server with a held-out test split. Human baseline results compared to state-of-the-art video QA models show a significant gap in performance (91.4% vs 45.8%), suggesting that there is significant room for improvement in multimodal video understanding.Dataset, baselines code, and challenge server are available at https://github.com/deepmind/perception_test

    * Abstract: Satellite imagery analytics have numerous human development and disaster response applications, particularly when time series methods are involved. For example, quantifying population statistics is fundamental to 67 of the 231 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators, but the World Bank estimates that over 100 countries currently lack effective Civil Registration systems. To help address this deficit and develop novel computer vision methods for time series data, we present the Multi-Temporal Urban Development SpaceNet (MUDS, also known as SpaceNet 7) dataset. This open source dataset consists of medium resolution (4.0m) satellite imagery mosaics, which includes 24 images (one per month) covering >100 unique geographies, and comprises >40,000 km2 of imagery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints therein, totaling over 11M individual annotations. Each building is assigned a unique identifier (i.e. address), which permits tracking of individual objects over time. Label fidelity exceeds image resolution; this "omniscient labeling" is a unique feature of the dataset, and enables surprisingly precise algorithmic models to be crafted. We demonstrate methods to track building footprint construction (or demolition) over time, thereby directly assessing urbanization. Performance is measured with the newly developed SpaceNet Change and Object Tracking (SCOT) metric, which quantifies both object tracking as well as change detection. We demonstrate that despite the moderate resolution of the data, we are able to track individual building identifiers over time.

    * Year: `2021`
    * Authors: Yanchao Yang, Brian Lai, Stefano Soatto
    * Abstract: We describe an unsupervised method to detect and segment portions of images of live scenes that, at some point in time, are seen moving as a coherent whole, which we refer to as objects. Our method first partitions the motion field by minimizing the mutual information between segments. Then, it uses the segments to learn object models that can be used for detection in a static image. Static and dynamic models are represented by deep neural networks trained jointly in a bootstrapping strategy, which enables extrapolation to previously unseen objects. While the training process requires motion, the resulting object segmentation network can be used on either static images or videos at inference time. As the volume of seen videos grows, more and more objects are seen moving, priming their detection, which then serves as a regularizer for new objects, turning our method into unsupervised continual learning to segment objects. Our models are compared to the state of the art in both video object segmentation and salient object detection. In the six benchmark datasets tested, our models compare favorably even to those using pixel-level supervision, despite requiring no manual annotation.

    * Year: `2022`
    * Authors: Wele Gedara Chaminda Bandara, Vishal M. Patel
    * Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse a registered high-resolution panchromatic image (PAN) with a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) to generate an enhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial resolution. Existing pansharpening approaches neglect using an attention mechanism to transfer HR texture features from PAN to LR-HSI features, resulting in spatial and spectral distortions. In this paper, we present a novel attention mechanism for pansharpening called HyperTransformer, in which features of LR-HSI and PAN are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer, respectively. HyperTransformer consists of three main modules, namely two separate feature extractors for PAN and HSI, a multi-head feature soft attention module, and a spatial-spectral feature fusion module. Such a network improves both spatial and spectral quality measures of the pansharpened HSI by learning cross-feature space dependencies and long-range details of PAN and LR-HSI. Furthermore, HyperTransformer can be utilized across multiple spatial scales at the backbone for obtaining improved performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that HyperTransformer achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on both spatial and spectral quality measures.

    * Year: `2022`
    * Authors: Guang Yu, Siqi Wang, Zhiping Cai, Xinwang Liu, Chuanfu Xu, Chengkun Wu
    * Abstract: While classic video anomaly detection (VAD) requires labeled normal videos for training, emerging unsupervised VAD (UVAD) aims to discover anomalies directly from fully unlabeled videos. However, existing UVAD methods still rely on shallow models to perform detection or initialization, and they are evidently inferior to classic VAD methods. This paper proposes a full deep neural network (DNN) based solution that can realize highly effective UVAD. First, we, for the first time, point out that deep reconstruction can be surprisingly effective for UVAD, which inspires us to unveil a property named "normality advantage", i.e., normal events will enjoy lower reconstruction loss when DNN learns to reconstruct unlabeled videos. With this property, we propose Localization based Reconstruction (LBR) as a strong UVAD baseline and a solid foundation of our solution. Second, we propose a novel self-paced refinement (SPR) scheme, which is synthesized into LBR to conduct UVAD. Unlike ordinary self-paced learning that injects more samples in an easy-to-hard manner, the proposed SPR scheme gradually drops samples so that suspicious anomalies can be removed from the learning process. In this way, SPR consolidates normality advantage and enables better UVAD in a more proactive way. Finally, we further design a variant solution that explicitly takes the motion cues into account. The solution evidently enhances the UVAD performance, and it sometimes even surpasses the best classic VAD methods. Experiments show that our solution not only significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods by a wide margin (5% to 9% AUROC), but also enables UVAD to catch up with the mainstream performance of classic VAD.

    * Authors: Tianjiao Li, Lin Geng Foo, Ping Hu, Xindi Shang, Hossein Rahmani, Zehuan Yuan, Jun Liu
    * Abstract: Learning with large-scale unlabeled data has become a powerful tool for pre-training Visual Transformers (VTs). However, prior works tend to overlook that, in real-world scenarios, the input data may be corrupted and unreliable. Pre-training VTs on such corrupted data can be challenging, especially when we pre-train via the masked autoencoding approach, where both the inputs and masked "ground truth" targets can potentially be unreliable in this case. To address this limitation, we introduce the Token Boosting Module (TBM) as a plug-and-play component for VTs that effectively allows the VT to learn to extract clean and robust features during masked autoencoding pre-training. We provide theoretical analysis to show how TBM improves model pre-training with more robust and generalizable representations, thus benefiting downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze TBM's effectiveness, and results on four corrupted datasets demonstrate that TBM consistently improves performance on downstream tasks.

    * Abstract: Automatic remote sensing tools can help inform many large-scale challenges such as disaster management, climate change, etc. While a vast amount of spatio-temporal satellite image data is readily available, most of it remains unlabelled. Without labels, this data is not very useful for supervised learning algorithms. Self-supervised learning instead provides a way to learn effective representations for various downstream tasks without labels. In this work, we leverage characteristics unique to satellite images to learn better self-supervised features. Specifically, we use the temporal signal to contrast images with long-term and short-term differences, and we leverage the fact that satellite images do not change frequently. Using these characteristics, we formulate a new loss contrastive loss called Change-Aware Contrastive (CACo) Loss. Further, we also present a novel method of sampling different geographical regions. We show that leveraging these properties leads to better performance on diverse downstream tasks. For example, we see a 6.5% relative improvement for semantic segmentation and an 8.5% relative improvement for change detection over the best-performing baseline with our method.

    * Authors: Lihe Yang, Lei Qi, Litong Feng, Wayne Zhang, Yinghuan Shi
    * Abstract: In this work, we revisit the weak-to-strong consistency framework, popularized by FixMatch from semi-supervised classification, where the prediction of a weakly perturbed image serves as supervision for its strongly perturbed version. Intriguingly, we observe that such a simple pipeline already achieves competitive results against recent advanced works, when transferred to our segmentation scenario. Its success heavily relies on the manual design of strong data augmentations, however, which may be limited and inadequate to explore a broader perturbation space. Motivated by this, we propose an auxiliary feature perturbation stream as a supplement, leading to an expanded perturbation space. On the other, to sufficiently probe original image-level augmentations, we present a dual-stream perturbation technique, enabling two strong views to be simultaneously guided by a common weak view. Consequently, our overall Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations approach (UniMatch) surpasses all existing methods significantly across all evaluation protocols on the Pascal, Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks. Its superiority is also demonstrated in remote sensing interpretation and medical image analysis. We hope our reproduced FixMatch and our results can inspire more future works.

    * Abstract: Visible-infrared (RGB-IR) image fusion has shown great potentials in object detection based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However the weakly misalignment problem between multimodal image pairs limits its performance in object detection. Most existing methods often ignore the modality gap and emphasize a strict alignment resulting in an upper bound of alignment quality and an increase of implementation costs. To address these challenges we propose a novel method named Offset-guided Adaptive Feature Alignment (OAFA) which could adaptively adjust the relative positions between multimodal features. Considering the impact of modality gap on the cross-modality spatial matching a Cross-modality Spatial Offset Modeling (CSOM) module is designed to establish a common subspace to estimate the precise feature-level offsets. Then an Offset-guided Deformable Alignment and Fusion (ODAF) module is utilized to implicitly capture optimal fusion positions for detection task rather than conducting a strict alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in the UAVs-based object detection task but also shows strong robustness to the weakly misalignment problem.

    * Abstract: We propose an efficient abnormal event detection model based on a lightweight masked auto-encoder (AE) applied at the video frame level. The novelty of the proposed model is threefold. First we introduce an approach to weight tokens based on motion gradients thus shifting the focus from the static background scene to the foreground objects. Second we integrate a teacher decoder and a student decoder into our architecture leveraging the discrepancy between the outputs given by the two decoders to improve anomaly detection. Third we generate synthetic abnormal events to augment the training videos and task the masked AE model to jointly reconstruct the original frames (without anomalies) and the corresponding pixel-level anomaly maps. Our design leads to an efficient and effective model as demonstrated by the extensive experiments carried out on four benchmarks: Avenue ShanghaiTech UBnormal and UCSD Ped2. The empirical results show that our model achieves an excellent trade-off between speed and accuracy obtaining competitive AUC scores while processing 1655 FPS. Hence our model is between 8 and 70 times faster than competing methods. We also conduct an ablation study to justify our design. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/aed-mae.

    * Authors: Pingping Zhang, Tianyu Yan, Yang Liu, Huchuan Lu
    * Abstract: As an important pillar of underwater intelligence Marine Animal Segmentation (MAS) involves segmenting animals within marine environments. Previous methods don't excel in extracting long-range contextual features and overlook the connectivity between discrete pixels. Recently Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a universal framework for general segmentation tasks. Unfortunately trained with natural images SAM does not obtain the prior knowledge from marine images. In addition the single-position prompt of SAM is very insufficient for prior guidance. To address these issues we propose a novel feature learning framework named Dual-SAM for high-performance MAS. To this end we first introduce a dual structure with SAM's paradigm to enhance feature learning of marine images. Then we propose a Multi-level Coupled Prompt (MCP) strategy to instruct comprehensive underwater prior information and enhance the multi-level features of SAM's encoder with adapters. Subsequently we design a Dilated Fusion Attention Module (DFAM) to progressively integrate multi-level features from SAM's encoder. Finally instead of directly predicting the masks of marine animals we propose a Criss-Cross Connectivity Prediction (C3P) paradigm to capture the inter-connectivity between discrete pixels. With dual decoders it generates pseudo-labels and achieves mutual supervision for complementary feature representations resulting in considerable improvements over previous techniques. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on five widely-used MAS datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Drchip61/Dual SAM.

    * Abstract: Remote sensing and automatic earth monitoring are key to solve global-scale challenges such as disaster prevention, land use monitoring, or tackling climate change. Although there exist vast amounts of remote sensing data, most of it remains unlabeled and thus inaccessible for supervised learning algorithms. Transfer learning approaches can reduce the data requirements of deep learning algorithms. However, most of these methods are pre-trained on ImageNet and their generalization to remote sensing imagery is not guaranteed due to the domain gap. In this work, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), an effective pipeline to leverage unlabeled data for in-domain pre-training of remote sensing representations. The SeCo pipeline is composed of two parts. First, a principled procedure to gather large-scale, unlabeled and uncurated remote sensing datasets containing images from multiple Earth locations at different timestamps. Second, a self-supervised algorithm that takes advantage of time and position invariance to learn transferable representations for remote sensing applications. We empirically show that models trained with SeCo achieve better performance than their ImageNet pre-trained counterparts and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on multiple downstream tasks. The datasets and models in SeCo will be made public to facilitate transfer learning and enable rapid progress in remote sensing applications.

    * Abstract: Understanding the visual world from the perspective of humans (egocentric) has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Egocentric videos exhibit high scene complexity and irregular motion flows compared to typical video understanding tasks. With the egocentric domain in mind, we address the problem of self-supervised, class-agnostic object detection, which aims to locate all objects in a given view, regardless of category, without any annotations or pre-training weights. Our method, self-supervised object Detection from Egocentric VIdeos (DEVI), generalizes appearance-based methods to learn features that are category-specific and invariant to viewing angles and illumination conditions from highly ambiguous environments in an end-to-end manner. Our approach leverages typical human behavior and its egocentric perception to sample diverse views of the same objects for our multi-view and scale-regression loss functions. With our learned cluster residual module, we are able to effectively describe multi-category patches for better complex scene understanding. DEVI provides a boost in performance on recent egocentric datasets, with performance gains up to 4.11% AP50, 0.11% AR1, 1.32% AR10, and 5.03% AR100, while significantly reducing model complexity. We also demonstrate competitive performance on out-of-domain datasets without additional training or fine-tuning.

    * Authors: Matías Mendieta, Boran Han, Xingjian Shi, Yi Zhu, Chen Chen
    * Abstract: Geospatial technologies are becoming increasingly essential in our world for a wide range of applications, including agriculture, urban planning, and disaster response. To help improve the applicability and performance of deep learning models on these geospatial tasks, various works have begun investigating foundation models for this domain. Researchers have explored two prominent approaches for introducing such models in geospatial applications, but both have drawbacks in terms of limited performance benefit or prohibitive training cost. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel paradigm for building highly effective geospatial foundation models with minimal resource cost and carbon impact. We first construct a compact yet diverse dataset from multiple sources to promote feature diversity, which we term GeoPile. Then, we investigate the potential of continual pretraining from large-scale ImageNet-22k models and propose a multi-objective continual pretraining paradigm, which leverages the strong representations of ImageNet while simultaneously providing the freedom to learn valuable in-domain features. Our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial pretraining methods in an extensive evaluation on seven downstream datasets covering various tasks such as change detection, classification, multi-label classification, semantic segmentation, and super-resolution.

    * Title: Rare Event Detection Using Disentangled Representation Learning
    * Year: `2019`
    * Authors: Ryuhei Hamaguchi,  Ken Sakurada,  Ryosuke Nakamura
    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for rare event detection from an image pair with class-imbalanced datasets. A straightforward approach for event detection tasks is to train a detection network from a large-scale dataset in an end-to-end manner. However, in many applications such as building change detection on satellite images, few positive samples are available for the training. Moreover, an image pair of scenes contains many trivial events, such as in illumination changes or background motions. These many trivial events and the class imbalance problem lead to false alarms for rare event detection. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel method to learn disentangled representations from only low-cost negative samples. The proposed method disentangles the different aspects in a pair of observations: variant and invariant factors that represent trivial events and image contents, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the quantitative evaluations on four change detection datasets, and the qualitative analysis shows that the proposed method can acquire the representations that disentangle rare events from trivial ones.

    * Abstract: Moving object segmentation in videos (MOS) is a highly demanding task for security-based applications like automated outdoor video surveillance. Most of the existing techniques proposed for MOS are highly depend on fine-tuning a model on the first frame(s) of test sequence or complicated training procedure, which leads to limited practical serviceability of the algorithm. In this paper, the inherent correlation learning-based edge extraction mechanism (EEM) and dense residual block (DRB) are proposed for the discriminative foreground representation. The multi-scale EEM module provides the efficient foreground edge related information (with the help of encoder) to the decoder through skip connection at subsequent scale. Further, the response of the optical flow encoder stream and the last EEM module are embedded in the bridge network. The bridge network comprises of multi-scale residual blocks with dense connections to learn the effective and efficient foreground relevant features. Finally, to generate accurate and consistent foreground object maps, a decoder block is proposed with skip connections from respective multi-scale EEM module feature maps and the subsequent down-sampled response of previous frame output. Specifically, the proposed network does not require any pre-trained models or fine-tuning of the parameters with the initial frame(s) of the test video. The performance of the proposed network is evaluated with different configurations like disjoint, cross-data, and global training-testing techniques. The ablation study is conducted to analyse each model of the proposed network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a comprehensive analysis on four benchmark video datasets is conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for MOS.

    * Title: Trading robust representations for sample complexity through self-supervised visual experience
    * Year: `2018`
    * Authors: Andrea Tacchetti, Stephen Voinea, Georgios Evangelopoulos
    * Abstract: Learning in small sample regimes is among the most remarkable features of the human perceptual system. This ability is related to robustness to transformations, which is acquired through visual experience in the form of weak- or self-supervision during development. We explore the idea of allowing artificial systems to learn representations of visual stimuli through weak supervision prior to downstream supervised tasks. We introduce a novel loss function for representation learning using unlabeled image sets and video sequences, and experimentally demonstrate that these representations support one-shot learning and reduce the sample complexity of multiple recognition tasks. We establish the existence of a trade-off between the sizes of weakly supervised, automatically obtained from video sequences, and fully supervised data sets. Our results suggest that equivalence sets other than class labels, which are abundant in unlabeled visual experience, can be used for self-supervised learning of semantically relevant image embeddings.

    * Title: Local Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Longitudinally-consistent Neuroimage Analysis
    * Year: `2022`
    * Authors: Mengwei Ren, Neel Dey, Martin Styner, Kelly Botteron, Guido Gerig
    * Abstract: Recent self-supervised advances in medical computer vision exploit the global and local anatomical self-similarity for pretraining prior to downstream tasks such as segmentation. However, current methods assume i.i.d. image acquisition, which is invalid in clinical study designs where follow-up longitudinal scans track subject-specific temporal changes. Further, existing self-supervised methods for medically-relevant image-to-image architectures exploit only spatial or temporal self-similarity and do so via a loss applied only at a single image-scale, with naive multi-scale spatiotemporal extensions collapsing to degenerate solutions. To these ends, this paper makes two contributions: (1) It presents a local and multi-scale spatiotemporal representation learning method for image-to-image architectures trained on longitudinal images. It exploits the spatiotemporal self-similarity of learned multi-scale intra-subject image features for pretraining and develops several feature-wise regularizations that avoid degenerate representations; (2) During finetuning, it proposes a surprisingly simple self-supervised segmentation consistency regularization to exploit intra-subject correlation. Benchmarked across various segmentation tasks, the proposed framework outperforms both well-tuned randomly-initialized baselines and current self-supervised techniques designed for both i.i.d. and longitudinal datasets. These improvements are demonstrated across both longitudinal neurodegenerative adult MRI and developing infant brain MRI and yield both higher performance and longitudinal consistency.

    * Title: CROMA: Remote Sensing Representations with Contrastive Radar-Optical Masked Autoencoders
    * Year: `2023`
    * Authors: Anthony Fuller, Koreen Millard, James Green
    * Abstract: A vital and rapidly growing application, remote sensing offers vast yet sparsely labeled, spatially aligned multimodal data; this makes self-supervised learning algorithms invaluable. We present CROMA: a framework that combines contrastive and reconstruction self-supervised objectives to learn rich unimodal and multimodal representations. Our method separately encodes masked-out multispectral optical and synthetic aperture radar samples—aligned in space and time—and performs cross-modal contrastive learning. Another encoder fuses these sensors, producing joint multimodal encodings that are used to predict the masked patches via a lightweight decoder. We show that these objectives are complementary when leveraged on spatially aligned multimodal data. We also introduce X- and 2D-ALiBi, which spatially biases our cross- and self-attention matrices. These strategies improve representations and allow our models to effectively extrapolate to images up to $17.6\times$ larger at test-time. CROMA outperforms the current SoTA multispectral model, evaluated on: four classification benchmarks—finetuning (avg.$\uparrow$ 1.8%), linear (avg.$\uparrow$ 2.4%) and nonlinear (avg.$\uparrow$ 1.4%) probing, $k$NN classification (avg.$\uparrow$ 3.5%), and $K$-means clustering (avg.$\uparrow$ 8.4%); and three segmentation benchmarks (avg.$\uparrow$ 6.4%). CROMA’s rich, optionally multimodal representations can be widely leveraged across remote sensing applications.

    * Authors: Congyue Deng, Jiahui Lei, William B Shen, Kostas Daniilidis, Leonidas J. Guibas
    * Abstract: Equivariance has gained strong interest as a desirable network property that inherently ensures robust generalization. However, when dealing with complex systems such as articulated objects or multi-object scenes, effectively capturing inter-part transformations poses a challenge, as it becomes entangled with the overall structure and local transformations. The interdependence of part assignment and per-part group action necessitates a novel equivariance formulation that allows for their co-evolution. In this paper, we present Banana, a Banach fixed-point network for equivariant segmentation with inter-part equivariance by construction. Our key insight is to iteratively solve a fixed-point problem, where point-part assignment labels and per-part SE(3)-equivariance co-evolve simultaneously. We provide theoretical derivations of both per-step equivariance and global convergence, which induces an equivariant final convergent state. Our formulation naturally provides a strict definition of inter-part equivariance that generalizes to unseen inter-part configurations. Through experiments conducted on both articulated objects and multi-object scans, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving strong generalization under inter-part transformations, even when confronted with substantial changes in pointcloud geometry and topology.

    * Abstract: The Landsat program is the longest-running Earth observation program in history, with 50+ years of data acquisition by 8 satellites. The multispectral imagery captured by sensors onboard these satellites is critical for a wide range of scientific fields. Despite the increasing popularity of deep learning and remote sensing, the majority of researchers still use decision trees and random forests for Landsat image analysis due to the prevalence of small labeled datasets and lack of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce SSL4EO-L, the first ever dataset designed for Self-Supervised Learning for Earth Observation for the Landsat family of satellites (including 3 sensors and 2 product levels) and the largest Landsat dataset in history (5M image patches). Additionally, we modernize and re-release the L7 Irish and L8 Biome cloud detection datasets, and introduce the first ML benchmark datasets for Landsats 4–5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ SR. Finally, we pre-train the first foundation models for Landsat imagery using SSL4EO-L and evaluate their performance on multiple semantic segmentation tasks. All datasets and model weights are available via the TorchGeo library, making reproducibility and experimentation easy, and enabling scientific advancements in the burgeoning field of remote sensing for a multitude of downstream applications.
