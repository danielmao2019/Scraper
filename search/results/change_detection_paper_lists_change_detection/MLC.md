    * Abstract: We focus on Continual Meta-Learning (CML), which targets accumulating and exploiting meta-knowledge on a sequence of non-i.i.d. tasks. The primary challenge is to strike a balance between stability and plasticity, where a model should be stable to avoid catastrophic forgetting in previous tasks and plastic to learn generalizable concepts from new tasks. To address this, we formulate the CML objective as controlling the average excess risk upper bound of the task sequence, which reflects the trade-off between forgetting and generalization. Based on the objective, we introduce a unified theoretical framework for CML in both static and shifting environments, providing guarantees for various task-specific learning algorithms. Moreover, we first present a rigorous analysis of a bi-level trade-off in shifting environments. To approach the optimal trade-off, we propose a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the meta-parameter and its learning rate w.r.t environment change. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory and algorithm.

    * Title: A Prior-Less Method for Multi-Face Tracking in Unconstrained Videos
    * Year: `2018`
    * Authors: Chung-Ching Lin, Ying Hung
    * Abstract: This paper presents a prior-less method for tracking and clustering an unknown number of human faces and maintaining their individual identities in unconstrained videos. The key challenge is to accurately track faces with partial occlusion and drastic appearance changes in multiple shots resulting from significant variations of makeup, facial expression, head pose and illumination. To address this challenge, we propose a new multi-face tracking and re-identification algorithm, which provides high accuracy in face association in the entire video with automatic cluster number generation, and is robust to outliers. We develop a co-occurrence model of multiple body parts to seamlessly create face tracklets, and recursively link tracklets to construct a graph for extracting clusters. A Gaussian Process model is introduced to compensate the deep feature insufficiency, and is further used to refine the linking results. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using a variety of challenging music videos and newly introduced body-worn camera videos. The proposed method obtains significant improvements over the state of the art [51], while relying less on handling video-specific prior information to achieve high performance.

    * Abstract: We present 3MASSIV, a multilingual, multimodal and multi-aspect, expertly-annotated dataset of diverse short videos extracted from a social media platform. 3MASSIV comprises of 50k short videos (20 seconds average duration) and 100K unlabeled videos in 11 different languages and captures popular short video trends like pranks, fails, romance, comedy expressed via unique audio-visual formats like self-shot videos, reaction videos, lip-synching, self-sung songs, etc. 3MASSIV presents an opportunity for multimodal and multilingual semantic understanding on these unique videos by annotating them for concepts, affective states, media types, and audio language. We present a thorough analysis of 3MASSIV and highlight the variety and unique aspects of our dataset compared to other contemporary popular datasets with strong baselines. We also show how the social media content in 3MASSIV is dynamic and temporal in nature which can be used for various semantic understanding tasks and cross-lingual analysis.

    Count: 1* EgoTV: Egocentric Task Verification from Natural Language Task Descriptions

    * Title: EgoTV: Egocentric Task Verification from Natural Language Task Descriptions
    * Year: `2023`
    * Authors: Rishi Hazra, Brian Chen, Akshara Rai, Nitin Kamra, Ruta Desai
    * Abstract: To enable progress towards egocentric agents capable of understanding everyday tasks specified in natural language, we propose a benchmark and a synthetic dataset called Egocentric Task Verification (EgoTV). The goal in EgoTV is to verify the execution of tasks from egocentric videos based on the natural language description of these tasks. EgoTV contains pairs of videos and their task descriptions for multi-step tasks -- these tasks contain multiple sub-task decompositions, state changes, object interactions, and sub-task ordering constraints. In addition, EgoTV also provides abstracted task descriptions that contain only partial details about ways to accomplish a task. Consequently, EgoTV requires causal, temporal, and compositional reasoning of video and language modalities, which is missing in existing datasets. We also find that existing vision-language models struggle at such all round reasoning needed for task verification in EgoTV. Inspired by the needs of EgoTV, we propose a novel Neuro-Symbolic Grounding (NSG) approach that leverages symbolic representations to capture the compositional and temporal structure of tasks. We demonstrate NSG's capability towards task tracking and verification on our EgoTV dataset and a real-world dataset derived from CrossTask (CTV). We open-source the EgoTV and CTV datasets and the NSG model for future research on egocentric assistive agents.

    * Abstract: Geospatial technologies are becoming increasingly essential in our world for a wide range of applications, including agriculture, urban planning, and disaster response. To help improve the applicability and performance of deep learning models on these geospatial tasks, various works have begun investigating foundation models for this domain. Researchers have explored two prominent approaches for introducing such models in geospatial applications, but both have drawbacks in terms of limited performance benefit or prohibitive training cost. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel paradigm for building highly effective geospatial foundation models with minimal resource cost and carbon impact. We first construct a compact yet diverse dataset from multiple sources to promote feature diversity, which we term GeoPile. Then, we investigate the potential of continual pretraining from large-scale ImageNet-22k models and propose a multi-objective continual pretraining paradigm, which leverages the strong representations of ImageNet while simultaneously providing the freedom to learn valuable in-domain features. Our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial pretraining methods in an extensive evaluation on seven downstream datasets covering various tasks such as change detection, classification, multi-label classification, semantic segmentation, and super-resolution.

    * Title: Robust Lipschitz Bandits to Adversarial Corruptions

    * Abstract: Lipschitz bandit is a variant of stochastic bandits that deals with a continuous arm set defined on a metric space, where the reward function is subject to a Lipschitz constraint. In this paper, we introduce a new problem of Lipschitz bandits in the presence of adversarial corruptions where an adaptive adversary corrupts the stochastic rewards up to a total budget $C$. The budget is measured by the sum of corruption levels across the time horizon $T$. We consider both weak and strong adversaries, where the weak adversary is unaware of the current action before the attack, while the strong one can observe it. Our work presents the first line of robust Lipschitz bandit algorithms that can achieve sub-linear regret under both types of adversary, even when the total budget of corruption $C$ is unrevealed to the agent. We provide a lower bound under each type of adversary, and show that our algorithm is optimal under the strong case. Finally, we conduct experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithms against two classic kinds of attacks.
