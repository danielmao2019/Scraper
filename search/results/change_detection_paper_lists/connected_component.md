    * Abstract: Learning causal structures from interventional data is a fundamental problem with broad applications across various fields. While many previous works have focused on recovering the entire causal graph, in practice, there are scenarios where learning only part of the causal graph suffices. This is called \emph{targeted} causal discovery. In our work, we focus on two such well-motivated problems: subset search and causal matching. We aim to minimize the number of interventions in both cases.Towards this, we introduce the \emph{Meek separator}, which is a subset of vertices that, when intervened, decomposes the remaining unoriented edges into smaller connected components. We then present an efficient algorithm to find Meek separators that are of small sizes. Such a procedure is helpful in designing various divide-and-conquer-based approaches. In particular, we propose two randomized algorithms that achieve logarithmic approximation for subset search and causal matching, respectively. Our results provide the first known average-case provable guarantees for both problems. We believe that this opens up possibilities to design near-optimal methods for many other targeted causal structure learning problems arising from various applications.

    * Abstract: Graph neural networks are prominent models for representation learning over graphs, where the idea is to iteratively compute representations of nodes of an input graph through a series of transformations in such a way that the learned graph function is isomorphism-invariant on graphs, which makes the learned representations graph invariants. On the other hand, it is well-known that graph invariants learned by these class of models are incomplete: there are pairs of non-isomorphic graphs which cannot be distinguished by standard graph neural networks. This is unsurprising given the computational difficulty of graph isomorphism testing on general graphs, but the situation begs to differ for special graph classes, for which efficient graph isomorphism testing algorithms are known, such as planar graphs. The goal of this work is to design architectures for efficiently learning complete invariants of planar graphs. Inspired by the classical planar graph isomorphism algorithm of Hopcroft and Tarjan, we propose PlanE as a framework for planar representation learning. PlanE includes architectures which can learn complete invariants over planar graphs while remaining practically scalable. We empirically validate the strong performance of the resulting model architectures on well-known planar graph benchmarks, achieving multiple state-of-the-art results.

    * Abstract: Representational limits of message-passing graph neural networks (MP-GNNs), e.g., in terms of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test for isomorphism, are well understood. Augmenting these graph models with topological features via persistent homology (PH) has gained prominence, but identifying the class of attributed graphs that PH can recognize remains open. We introduce a novel concept of color-separating sets to provide a complete resolution to this important problem. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing graphs based on the persistence of their connected components, obtained from filter functions on vertex and edge colors. Our constructions expose the limits of vertex- and edge-level PH, proving that neither category subsumes the other. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose RePHINE for learning topological features on graphs. RePHINE efficiently combines vertex- and edge-level PH, achieving a scheme that is provably more powerful than both. Integrating RePHINE into MP-GNNs boosts their expressive power, resulting in gains over standard PH on several benchmarks for graph classification.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel, large-scale, structure-from-motion framework that advances the state of the art in data scalability from city-scale modeling (millions of images) to world-scale modeling (several tens of millions of images) using just a single computer. The main enabling technology is the use of a streaming-based framework for connected component discovery. Moreover, our system employs an adaptive, online, iconic image clustering approach based on an augmented bag-of-words representation, in order to balance the goals of registration, comprehensiveness, and data compactness. We demonstrate our proposal by operating on a recent publicly available 100 million image crowd-sourced photo collection containing images geographically distributed throughout the entire world. Results illustrate that our streaming-based approach does not compromise model completeness, but achieves unprecedented levels of efficiency and scalability.

    * Authors: Qian Ge, Edgar Lobaton
    * Abstract: Image segmentation is one of the most important low-level operation in image processing and computer vision. It is unlikely for a single algorithm with a fixed set of parameters to segment various images successfully due to variations between images. However, it can be observed that the desired boundaries are often detected more consistently than other ones in the output of state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new approach to capture the consensus information from a segmentation set obtained by different algorithms. The present probability of a segment curve is estimated based on our probabilistic segmentation model. A connectivity probability map is constructed and persistent segments are extracted by applying topological persistence to the map. Finally, a robust segmentation is obtained with the detection of certain segment curves guaranteed. The experiments demonstrate our approach is able to consistently capture the curves present within the segmentation set.

    * Abstract: Sparse LiDAR point clouds cause severe loss of detail of static structures and reduce the density of static points available for navigation. Reduced density can be detrimental to navigation under several scenarios. We observe that despite high sparsity in most cases the global topology of LiDAR outlining the static structures can be inferred. We utilize this property to obtain a backbone skeleton of a LiDAR scan in the form of a single connected component that is a proxy to its global topology. We utilize the backbone to augment new points along static structures to overcome sparsity. Newly introduced points could correspond to existing static structures or to static points that were earlier obstructed by dynamic objects. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to use such a strategy for sparse LiDAR point clouds. Existing solutions close to our approach fail to identify and preserve the global static LiDAR topology and generate sub-optimal points. We propose GLiDR a Graph Generative network that is topologically regularized using 0-dimensional Persistent Homology (PH) constraints. This enables GLiDR to introduce newer static points along a topologically consistent global static LiDAR backbone. GLiDR generates precise static points using 32x sparser dynamic scans and performs better than the baselines across three datasets. GLiDR generates a valuable byproduct - an accurate binary segmentation mask of static and dynamic objects that are helpful for navigation planning and safety in constrained environments. The newly introduced static points allow GLiDR to outperform LiDAR-based navigation using SLAM in several settings.

We introduce a topological loss term based on persistent homology to reconstruct a manifold object of genus 1. Building on the Neural Pull \citep ma2020neural framework our method demonstrates superior performance in preserving the integrity of complex 3D geometries evident through both visual and empirical comparisons. Our contributions include the integration of persistent diagrams to refine shape topology and a topological loss term to constrain existing reconstruction pipelines to a single connected component. This advancement allows for the seamless integration of topological data analysis with implicit surface reconstruction.

    * Abstract: Detecting statistical interactions between input features is a crucial and challenging task. Recent advances demonstrate that it is possible to extract learned interactions from trained neural networks. It has also been observed that, in neural networks, any interacting features must follow a strongly weighted connection to common hidden units. Motivated by the observation, in this paper, we propose to investigate the interaction detection problem from a novel topological perspective by analyzing the connectivity in neural networks. Specially, we propose a new measure for quantifying interaction strength, based upon the well-received theory of persistent homology. Based on this measure, a Persistence Interaction Dection (PID) algorithm is developed to efficiently detect interactions. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated across a number of interaction detection tasks on several synthetic and real-world datasets with different hyperparameters. Experimental results validate that the PID algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

    * Abstract: We propose representing one's visual experiences (captured as a series of ego-centric videos) as a sparse-graph, where each node is an individual frame in the video, and nodes are connected if there exists a geometric transform between them. Such a graph is massive and contains millions of edges. Autobiographical egocentric visual data are highly redundant, and we show how the graph representation and graph clustering can be used to exploit redundancy in the data. We show that popular global clustering methods like spectral clustering and multi-level graph partitioning perform poorly for clustering egocentric visual data. We propose using local density clustering algorithms for clustering the data, and provide detailed qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the two approaches. The graph-representation and clustering are used to aggressively prune the database. By retaining only representative nodes from dense sub graphs, we achieve 90% of peak recall by retaining only 1% of data, with a significant 18% improvement in absolute recall over naive uniform subsampling of the egocentric video data.

    * Abstract: We propose a scheme that allows to partition an image into a previously unknown number of segments, using only minimal supervision in terms of a few must-link and cannotlink annotations. We make no use of regional data terms, learning instead what constitutes a likely boundary between segments. Since boundaries are only implicitly specified through cannot-link constraints, this is a hard and nonconvex latent variable problem. We address this problem in a greedy fashion using a randomized decision tree on features associated with interpixel edges. We use a structured purity criterion during tree construction and also show how a backtracking strategy can be used to prevent the greedy search from ending up in poor local optima. The proposed strategy is compared with prior art on natural images.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of \emph{blocked} collaborative bandits where there are multiple users, each with an associated multi-armed bandit problem. These users are grouped into \emph{latent} clusters such that the mean reward vectors of users within the same cluster are identical. Our goal is to design algorithms that maximize the cumulative reward accrued by all the users over time, under the \emph{constraint} that no arm of a user is pulled more than $\mathsf{B}$ times. This problem has been originally considered by \cite{Bresler:2014}, and designing regret-optimal algorithms for it has since remained an open problem.In this work, we propose an algorithm called B-LATTICE (Blocked Latent bAndiTs via maTrIx ComplEtion) that collaborates across users, while simultaneously satisfying the budget constraints, to maximize their cumulative rewards. Theoretically, under certain reasonable assumptions on the latent structure, with $\mathsf{M}$ users, $\mathsf{N}$ arms, $\mathsf{T}$ rounds per user, and $\mathsf{C}=O(1)$ latent clusters, B-LATTICE achieves a per-user regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathsf{T}(1 + \mathsf{N}\mathsf{M}^{-1})})$ under a budget constraint of $\mathsf{B}=\Theta(\log \mathsf{T})$. These are the first sub-linear regret bounds for this problem, and match the minimax regret bounds when $\mathsf{B}=\mathsf{T}$. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithm has superior performance over baselines even when $\mathsf{B}=1$. B-LATTICE is a phased algorithm where in each phase it clusters users into groups and collaborates across users within a group to quickly learn their reward models.

    * Abstract: The incorporation of cutting planes within the branch-and-bound algorithm, known as branch-and-cut, forms the backbone of modern integer programming solvers. These solvers are the foremost method for solving discrete optimization problems and thus have a vast array of applications in machine learning, operations research, and many other fields. Choosing cutting planes effectively is a major research topic in the theory and practice of integer programming. We conduct a novel structural analysis of branch-and-cut that pins down how every step of the algorithm is affected by changes in the parameters defining the cutting planes added to the input integer program. Our main application of this analysis is to derive sample complexity guarantees for using machine learning to determine which cutting planes to apply during branch-and-cut. These guarantees apply to infinite families of cutting planes, such as the family of Gomory mixed integer cuts, which are responsible for the main breakthrough speedups of integer programming solvers. We exploit geometric and combinatorial structure of branch-and-cut in our analysis, which provides a key missing piece for the recent generalization theory of branch-and-cut.

    * Abstract: We consider the following constrained maximization problem in discrete probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Given two (possibly identical) PGMs $M_1$ and $M_2$ defined over the same set of variables and a real number $q$, find an assignment of values to all variables such that the probability of the assignment is maximized w.r.t. $M_1$ and is smaller than $q$ w.r.t. $M_2$. We show that several explanation and robust estimation queries over graphical models are special cases of this problem. We propose a class of approximate algorithms for solving this problem. Our algorithms are based on a graph concept called $k$-separator and heuristic algorithms for multiple choice knapsack and subset-sum problems. Our experiments show that our algorithms are superior to the following approach: encode the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and solve the latter using a state-of-the-art MILP solver such as SCIP.

    * Abstract: Our aim is to provide a pixel-wise instance-level labeling of a monocular image in the context of autonomous driving. We build on recent work [Zhang et al., ICCV15] that trained a convolutional neural net to predict instance labeling in local image patches, extracted exhaustively in a stride from an image. A simple Markov random field model using several heuristics was then proposed in [Zhang et al., ICCV15] to derive a globally consistent instance labeling of the image. In this paper, we formulate the global labeling problem with a novel densely connected Markov random field and show how to encode various intuitive potentials in a way that is amenable to efficient mean field inference [Krahenbuhl et al., NIPS11]. Our potentials encode the compatibility between the global labeling and the patch-level predictions, contrast-sensitive smoothness as well as the fact that separate regions form different instances. Our experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark [Geiger et al., CVPR12] demonstrate that our method achieves a significant performance boost over the baseline [Zhang et al., ICCV15].

    * Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.

    * Abstract: Egocentric action analysis methods often assume that input videos are trimmed and hence they tend to focus on action classification rather than recognition. Consequently, adopted evaluation schemes are often unable to assess important properties of the desired action video segmentation output, which are deemed to be meaningful in real scenarios (e.g., oversegmentation and boundary localization precision). To overcome the limits of current evaluation methodologies, we propose a set of measures aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of egocentric action recognition methods. To improve exploitability of current action classification methods in the recognition scenario, we investigate how frame-wise predictions can be turned into action-based temporal video segmentations. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed set of measures can help to improve evaluation and to drive the design of egocentric action recognition methods.

    * Abstract: Recent works show that image comparison based on local descriptors is corrupted by visual bursts, which tend to dominate the image similarity. The existing strategies, like power-law normalization, improve the results by discounting the contribution of visual bursts to the image similarity. In this paper, we propose to explicitly detect the visual bursts in an image at an early stage. We compare several detection strategies jointly taking into account feature similarity and geometrical quantities. The bursty groups are merged into meta-features, which are used as input to state-of-the-art image search systems such as VLAD or the selective match kernel. Then, we show the interest of using this strategy in an asymmetrical manner, with only the database features being aggregated but not those of the query. Extensive experiments performed on public benchmarks for visual retrieval show the benefits of our method, which achieves performance on par with the state of the art but with a significantly reduced complexity, thanks to the lower number of features fed to the indexing system.

Towards this goal, we take advantage of convolutional neural nets and train them to directly predict instance-level segmentations where the instance ID encodes the depth ordering within image patches. To provide a coherent single explanation of an image we develop a Markov random field which takes as input the predictions of convolutional neural nets applied at overlapping patches of different resolutions, as well as the output of a connected component algorithm. It aims to predict accurate instance-level segmentation and depth ordering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging KITTI benchmark and show good performance on both tasks.

    * Abstract: Lipschitz constraints under L2 norm on deep neural networks are useful for provable adversarial robustness bounds, stable training, and Wasserstein distance estimation. While heuristic approaches such as the gradient penalty have seen much practical success, it is challenging to achieve similar practical performance while provably enforcing a Lipschitz constraint. In principle, one can design Lipschitz constrained architectures using the composition property of Lipschitz functions, but Anil et al. recently identified a key obstacle to this approach: gradient norm attenuation. They showed how to circumvent this problem in the case of fully connected networks by designing each layer to be gradient norm preserving. We extend their approach to train scalable, expressive, provably Lipschitz convolutional networks. In particular, we present the Block Convolution Orthogonal Parameterization (BCOP), an expressive parameterization of orthogonal convolution operations. We show that even though the space of orthogonal convolutions is disconnected, the largest connected component of BCOP with 2n channels can represent arbitrary BCOP convolutions over n channels. Our BCOP parameterization allows us to train large convolutional networks with provable Lipschitz bounds. Empirically, we find that it is competitive with existing approaches to provable adversarial robustness and Wasserstein distance estimation.

    * Abstract: Noisy labels can impair the performance of deep neural networks. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a new method for filtering label noise. Unlike most existing methods relying on the posterior probability of a noisy classifier, we focus on the much richer spatial behavior of data in the latent representational space. By leveraging the high-order topological information of data, we are able to collect most of the clean data and train a high-quality model. Theoretically we prove that this topological approach is guaranteed to collect the clean data with high probability. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts and is robust to a broad spectrum of noise types and levels.

    * Abstract: Pure exploration in multi-armed bandits has emerged as an important framework for modeling decision making and search under uncertainty. In modern applications however, one is often faced with a tremendously large number of options and even obtaining one observation per option may be too costly rendering traditional pure exploration algorithms ineffective. Fortunately, one often has access to similarity relationships amongst the options that can be leveraged. In this paper, we consider the pure exploration problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits where the similarities between the arms is captured by a graph and the rewards may be represented as a smooth signal on this graph. In particular, we consider the problem of finding the arm with the maximum reward (i.e., the maximizing problem) or one that has sufficiently high reward (i.e., the satisficing problem) under this model. We propose novel algorithms GRUB (GRaph based UcB) and zeta-GRUB for these problems and provide theoretical characterization of their performance which specifically elicits the benefit of the graph side information. We also prove a lower bound on the data requirement that shows a large class of problems where these algorithms are near-optimal. We complement our theory with experimental results that show the benefit of capitalizing on such side information.

    * Abstract: We propose a hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) model that learns how to cluster a set of images into an unknown number of identities using a training set of images annotated with labels belonging to a disjoint set of identities. Our hierarchical GNN uses a novel approach to merge connected components predicted at each level of the hierarchy to form a new graph at the next level. Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 49% improvement in F-score and 7% increase in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) relative to current GNN-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, state-of-the-art GNN-based methods rely on separate models to predict linkage probabilities and node densities as intermediate steps of the clustering process. In contrast, our unified framework achieves a three-fold decrease in computational cost. Our training and inference code are released.

    * Abstract: In 3D computer vision, translation averaging solves for absolute translations given a set of pairwise relative translation directions. While there has been much work on robustness to outliers and studies on the uniqueness of the solution, this paper deals with a distinctly different problem of sensitivity in translation averaging under uncertainty. We first analyze sensitivity in estimating scales corresponding to relative directions under small perturbations of the relative directions. Then, we formally define the conditioning of the translation averaging problem, which assesses the reliability of estimated translations based solely on the input directions. We give a sufficient criterion to ensure that the problem is well-conditioned. Subsequently, we provide an efficient algorithm to identify and remove combinations of directions which make the problem ill-conditioned while ensuring uniqueness of the solution. We demonstrate the utility of such analysis in global structure-from-motion pipelines for obtaining 3D reconstructions, which reveals the benefits of filtering the ill-conditioned set of directions in translation averaging in terms of reduced translation errors, a higher number of 3D points triangulated and faster convergence of bundle adjustment.

    * Abstract: Shapes are often designed to satisfy structural properties and serve a particular functionality in the physical world. Unfortunately, most existing generative models focus primarily on the geometric or visual plausibility, ignoring the physical or structural constraints. To remedy this, we present a novel method aimed to endow deep generative models with physical reasoning. In particular, we introduce a loss and a learning framework that promote two key characteristics of the generated shapes: their connectivity and physical stability. The former ensures that each generated shape consists of a single connected component, while the latter promotes the stability of that shape when subjected to gravity. Our proposed physical losses are fully differentiable and we demonstrate their use in end-to-end learning. Crucially we demonstrate that such physical objectives can be achieved without sacrificing the expressive power of the model and variability of the generated results. We demonstrate through extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art deep generative models, the utility and efficiency of our proposed approach, while avoiding the potentially costly differentiable physical simulation at training time.

    * Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for finding an unknown number of geometric models, e.g., homographies. The problem is formalized as finding dominant model instances progressively without forming crisp point-to-model assignments. Dominant instances are found via a RANSAC-like sampling and a consolidation process driven by a model quality function considering previously proposed instances. New ones are found by clustering in the consensus space. This new formulation leads to a simple iterative algorithm with state-of-the-art accuracy while running in real-time on a number of vision problems -- at least two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors on two-view motion estimation. Also, we propose a deterministic sampler reflecting the fact that real-world data tend to form spatially coherent structures. The sampler returns connected components in a progressively densified neighborhood-graph. We present a number of applications where the use of multiple geometric models improves accuracy. These include pose estimation from multiple generalized homographies; trajectory estimation of fast-moving objects; and we also propose a way of using multiple homographies in global SfM algorithms.

    * Abstract: Deep Learning based segmentation models for medical imaging often fail under subtle distribution shifts calling into question the robustness of these models. Medical images however have the unique feature that there is limited structural variability between patients. We propose to exploit this notion and improve the robustness of deep learning based segmentation models by constraining the latent space to a learnt dictionary of base components. We incorporate a topological prior using persistent homology in the sampling of our dictionary to ensure topological accuracy after composition of the components. We further improve robustness by deep topological supervision applied in an hierarchical manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under various perturbations and in two single domain generalisation tasks.

    * Abstract: Multi-Camera Multi-Object Tracking (MC-MOT) utilizes information from multiple views to better handle problems with occlusion and crowded scenes. Recently, the use of graph-based approaches to solve tracking problems has become very popular. However, many current graph-based methods do not effectively utilize information regarding spatial and temporal consistency. Instead, they rely on single-camera trackers as input, which are prone to fragmentation and ID switch errors. In this paper, we propose a novel reconfigurable graph model that first associates all detected objects across cameras spatially before reconfiguring it into a temporal graph for Temporal Association. This two-stage association approach enables us to extract robust spatial and temporal-aware features and address the problem with fragmented tracklets. Furthermore, our model is designed for online tracking, making it suitable for real-world applications. Experimental results show that the proposed graph model is able to extract more discriminating features for object tracking, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.

    * Abstract: Detecting the openable parts of articulated objects is crucial for downstream applications in intelligent robotics, such as pulling a drawer. This task poses a multitasking challenge due to the necessity of understanding object categories and motion. Most existing methods are either category-specific or trained on specific datasets, lacking generalization to unseen environments and objects. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based Openable Part Detection (OPD) framework named Multi-feature Openable Part Detection (MOPD) that incorporates perceptual grouping and geometric priors, outperforming previous methods in performance. In the first stage of the framework, we introduce a perceptual grouping feature model that provides perceptual grouping feature priors for openable part detection, enhancing detection results through a cross-attention mechanism. In the second stage, a geometric understanding feature model offers geometric feature priors for predicting motion parameters. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach shows better performance in both detection and motion parameter prediction.

    * Abstract: Recently, unsupervised image segmentation has become increasingly popular. Starting from a superpixel segmentation, an edge-weighted region adjacency graph is constructed. Amongst all segmentations of the graph, the one which best conforms to the given image evidence, as measured by the sum of cut edge weights, is chosen. Since this problem is NP-hard, we propose a new approximate solver based on the move-making paradigm: first, the graph is recursively partitioned into small regions (cut phase). Then, for any two adjacent regions, we consider alternative cuts of these two regions defining possible moves (glue & cut phase). For planar problems, the optimal move can be found, whereas for non-planar problems, efficient approximations exist. We evaluate our algorithm on published and new benchmark datasets, which we make available here. The proposed algorithm finds segmentations that, as measured by a loss function, are as close to the ground-truth as the global optimum found by exact solvers. It does so significantly faster then existing approximate methods, which is important for large-scale problems.

    * Abstract: The diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer relies on histopathology image analysis where markers such as Ki-67 are increasingly important. The diagnosis using this marker is based on quantification of proliferation which implies counting of Ki-67 positive and negative tumoral cells excluding stromal cells. A common problem for automatic quantification of these images derives from overlapping and clustering of cells. We propose in this paper an automatic segmentation and classification system that overcomes this problem using two Convolutional Neural Networks (Dual U-Net) whose results are combined with a watershed algorithm. Taking into account that a major issue for the development of reliable neural networks is the availability of labeled databases we also introduce an approach for epistemic uncertainty estimation that can be used for active learning in instance segmentation applications. We use Monte Carlo Dropout within our networks to quantify the model's confidence across its predictions offering insights into areas of high uncertainty. Our results show how the postprocessed uncertainty maps can be used to refine ground truth annotations and to generate new labeled data with reduced annotation effort. To initialize the labeling and further reduce this effort we propose a tool for groundtruth generation which is based on candidate generation with maxtree. Candidates are filtered based on extracted features which can be adjusted for the specific image typology thereby facilitating precise model training and evaluation.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose Sequential Grouping Networks (SGN) to tackle the problem of object instance segmentation. SGNs employ a sequence of neural networks, each solving a sub-grouping problem of increasing semantic complexity in order to gradually compose objects out of pixels. In particular, the first network aims to group pixels along each image row and column by predicting horizontal and vertical object breakpoints. These breakpoints are then used to create line segments. By exploiting two-directional information, the second network groups horizontal and vertical lines into connected components. Finally, the third network groups the connected components into object instances. Our experiments show that our SGN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both, the Cityscapes dataset as well as PASCAL VOC.

    * Abstract: Tensor factorizations have become popular methods for learning from multi-relational data. In this context, the rank of a factorization is an important parameter that determines runtime as well as generalization ability. To determine conditions under which factorization is an efficient approach for learning from relational data, we derive upper and lower bounds on the rank required to recover adjacency tensors. Based on our findings, we propose a novel additive tensor factorization model for learning from latent and observable patterns in multi-relational data and present a scalable algorithm for computing the factorization. Experimentally, we show that the proposed approach does not only improve the predictive performance over pure latent variable methods but that it also reduces the required rank --- and therefore runtime and memory complexity --- significantly.

We further extend existing graph-based methods to approximate the cluster tree of a distribution. By avoiding direct density estimation, our method is able to handle high-dimensional data more efficiently than existing density-based approaches. We present empirical results that demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing ones.

Due to its inherent cache locality and conflict-free nature, our multi-core implementation of Cyclades consistently outperforms Hogwild!-type algorithms on sufficiently sparse datasets, leading to up to 40% speedup gains compared to Hogwild!, and up to 5\times gains over asynchronous implementations of variance reduction algorithms.

    * Abstract: Segmentation algorithms are prone to make topological errors on fine-scale struc- tures, e.g., broken connections. We propose a novel method that learns to segment with correct topology. In particular, we design a continuous-valued loss function that enforces a segmentation to have the same topology as the ground truth, i.e.,having the same Betti number. The proposed topology-preserving loss function is differentiable and can be incorporated into end-to-end training of a deep neural network. Our method achieves much better performance on the Betti number error, which directly accounts for the topological correctness. It also performs superior on other topology-relevant metrics, e.g., the Adjusted Rand Index and the Variation of Information, without sacrificing per-pixel accuracy. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a broad spectrum of natural and biomedical datasets.

    * Authors: Heinrich Jiang, Jennifer Jang, Jakub Lacki
    * Abstract: DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm. It computes the $\epsilon$-neighborhood graph of a dataset and uses the connected components of the high-degree nodes to decide the clusters. However, the full neighborhood graph may be too costly to compute with a worst-case complexity of $O(n^2)$. In this paper, we propose a simple variant called SNG-DBSCAN, which clusters based on a subsampled $\epsilon$-neighborhood graph, only requires access to similarity queries for pairs of points and in particular avoids any complex data structures which need the embeddings of the data points themselves. The runtime of the procedure is $O(sn^2)$, where $s$ is the sampling rate. We show under some natural theoretical assumptions that $s \approx \log n/n$ is sufficient for statistical cluster recovery guarantees leading to an $O(n\log n)$ complexity. We provide an extensive experimental analysis showing that on large datasets, one can subsample as little as $0.1\%$ of the neighborhood graph, leading to as much as over 200x speedup and 250x reduction in RAM consumption compared to scikit-learn's implementation of DBSCAN, while still maintaining competitive clustering performance.

    * Abstract: Can graph neural networks generalize to graphs that are different from the graphs they were trained on, e.g., in size? In this work, we study this question from a theoretical perspective. While recent work established such transferability and approximation results via graph limits, e.g., via graphons, these only apply nontrivially to dense graphs. To include frequently encountered sparse graphs such as bounded-degree or power law graphs, we take a perspective of taking limits of operators derived from graphs, such as the aggregation operation that makes up GNNs. This leads to the recently introduced limit notion of graphops (Backhausz and Szegedy, 2022). We demonstrate how the operator perspective allows us to develop quantitative bounds on the distance between a finite GNN and its limit on an infinite graph, as well as the distance between the GNN on graphs of different sizes that share structural properties, under a regularity assumption verified for various graph sequences. Our results hold for dense and sparse graphs, and various notions of graph limits.

    * Abstract: The graph retrieval problem is to search in a large corpus of graphs for ones that are most similar to a query graph. A common consideration for scoring similarity is the maximum common subgraph (MCS) between the query and corpus graphs, usually counting the number of common edges (i.e., MCES). In some applications, it is also desirable that the common subgraph be connected, i.e., the maximum common connected subgraph (MCCS). Finding exact MCES and MCCS is intractable, but may be unnecessary if ranking corpus graphs by relevance is the goal. We design fast and trainable neural functions that approximate MCES and MCCS well. Late interaction methods compute dense representations for the query and corpus graph separately, and compare these representations using simple similarity functions at the last stage, leading to highly scalable systems. Early interaction methods combine information from both graphs right from the input stages, are usually considerably more accurate, but slower. We propose both late and early interaction neural MCES and MCCS formulations. They are both based on a continuous relaxation of a node alignment matrix between query and corpus nodes. For MCCS, we propose a novel differentiable network for estimating the size of the largest connected common subgraph. Extensive experiments with seven data sets show that our proposals are superior among late interaction models in terms of both accuracy and speed. Our early interaction models provide accuracy competitive with the state of the art, at substantially greater speeds.

    * Authors: Markus Utke, Ulrike Schmidt-Kraepelin
    * Abstract: Liquid democracy with ranked delegations is a novel voting scheme that unites the practicability of representative democracy with the idealistic appeal of direct democracy: Every voter decides between casting their vote on a question at hand or delegating their voting weight to some other, trusted agent. Delegations are transitive, and since voters may end up in a delegation cycle, they are encouraged to indicate not only a single delegate, but a set of potential delegates and a ranking among them. Based on the delegation preferences of all voters, a delegation rule selects one representative per voter. Previous work has revealed a trade-off between two properties of delegation rules called anonymity and copy-robustness. To overcome this issue we study two fractional delegation rules: Mixed Borda branching, which generalizes a rule satisfying copy-robustness, and the random walk rule, which satisfies anonymity. Using the Markov chain tree theorem, we show that the two rules are in fact equivalent, and simultaneously satisfy generalized versions of the two properties. Combining the same theorem with Fulkerson's algorithm, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the outcome of the studied delegation rule. This algorithm is of independent interest, having applications in semi-supervised learning and graph theory.

    * Abstract: Discrete graphical models (also known as discrete Markov random fields) are a major conceptual tool to model the structure of optimization problems in computer vision. While in the last decade research has focused on fast approximative methods, algorithms that provide globally optimal solutions have come more into the research focus in the last years. However, large scale computer vision problems seemed to be out of reach for such methods. In this paper we introduce a promising way to bridge this gap based on partial optimality and structural properties of the underlying problem factorization. Combining these preprocessing steps, we are able to solve grids of size 2048 x 2048 in less than 90 seconds. On the hitherto unsolvable Chinese character dataset of Nowozin et al. we obtain provably optimal results in 56% of the instances and achieve competitive runtimes on other recent benchmark problems. While in the present work only generalized Potts models are considered, an extension to general graphical models seems to be feasible.

    * Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the position of a viewer inside a room of planar mirrors with unknown geometry in conjunction with the room's shape parameters. We consider the observations to consist of angularly resolved depth measurements of a single scene point that is being observed via many multi-bounce interactions with the specular room geometry. Applications of this problem statement include areas such as calibration, acoustic echo cancelation and time-of-flight imaging. We theoretically analyze the problem and derive sufficient conditions for a combination of convex room geometry, observer, and scene point to be reconstructable. The resulting constructive algorithm is exponential in nature and, therefore, not directly applicable to practical scenarios. To counter the situation, we propose theoretically devised geometric constraints that enable an efficient pruning of the solution space and develop a heuristic randomized search algorithm that uses these constraints to obtain an effective solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on extensive simulations as well as in a challenging real-world calibration scenario.

    * Abstract: In Structure-from-Motion (SfM) the underlying viewgraphs of unordered image collections generally have a highly redundant set of edges that can be sparsified for efficiency without significant loss of reconstruction quality. Often there are also false edges due to incorrect image retrieval and repeated structures (symmetries) that give rise to ghosting and superimposed reconstruction artifacts. We present a unified method to simultaneously sparsify the viewgraph and remove false edges. We propose a scoring mechanism based on camera triplets that identifies edge redundancy as well as false edges. Our edge selection is formulated as an optimization problem which can be provably solved using a simple thresholding scheme. This results in a highly efficient algorithm which can be incorporated as a pre-processing step into any SfM pipeline making it practically usable. We demonstrate the utility of our method on generic and ambiguous datasets that cover the range of small medium and large-scale datasets all with different statistical properties. Sparsification of generic datasets using our method significantly reduces reconstruction time while maintaining the accuracy of the reconstructions as well as removing ghosting artifacts. For ambiguous datasets our method removes false edges thereby avoiding incorrect superimposed reconstructions.

    * Abstract: The existence of noisy data is prevalent in both the training and testing phases of machine learning systems, which inevitably leads to the degradation of model performance. There have been plenty of works concentrated on learning with in-distribution (IND) noisy labels in the last decade, i.e., some training samples are assigned incorrect labels that do not correspond to their true classes. Nonetheless, in real application scenarios, it is necessary to consider the influence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, i.e., samples that do not belong to any known classes, which has not been sufficiently explored yet. To remedy this, we study a new problem setup, namely Learning with Open-world Noisy Data (LOND). The goal of LOND is to simultaneously learn a classifier and an OOD detector from datasets with mixed IND and OOD noise. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based framework, namely Noisy Graph Cleaning (NGC), which collects clean samples by leveraging geometric structure of data and model predictive confidence. Without any additional training effort, NGC can detect and reject the OOD samples based on the learned class prototypes directly in testing phase. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmarks with different types of noise and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against state of the arts.

    * Abstract: Co-clustering methods have been widely applied to document clustering and gene expression analysis. These methods make use of the duality between features and samples such that the co-occurring structure of sample and feature clusters can be extracted. In graph based co-clustering methods, a bipartite graph is constructed to depict the relation between features and samples. Most existing co-clustering methods conduct clustering on the graph achieved from the original data matrix, which doesn’t have explicit cluster structure, thus they require a post-processing step to obtain the clustering results. In this paper, we propose a novel co-clustering method to learn a bipartite graph with exactly k connected components, where k is the number of clusters. The new bipartite graph learned in our model approximates the original graph but maintains an explicit cluster structure, from which we can immediately get the clustering results without post-processing. Extensive empirical results are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our model.

    * Abstract: Deep learning methods for graphs achieve remarkable performance on many node-level and graph-level prediction tasks. However, despite the proliferation of the methods and their success, prevailing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) neglect subgraphs, rendering subgraph prediction tasks challenging to tackle in many impactful applications. Further, subgraph prediction tasks present several unique challenges: subgraphs can have non-trivial internal topology, but also carry a notion of position and external connectivity information relative to the underlying graph in which they exist. Here, we introduce SubGNN, a subgraph neural network to learn disentangled subgraph representations. We propose a novel subgraph routing mechanism that propagates neural messages between the subgraph’s components and randomly sampled anchor patches from the underlying graph, yielding highly accurate subgraph representations. SubGNN specifies three channels, each designed to capture a distinct aspect of subgraph topology, and we provide empirical evidence that the channels encode their intended properties. We design a series of new synthetic and real-world subgraph datasets. Empirical results for subgraph classification on eight datasets show that SubGNN achieves considerable performance gains, outperforming strong baseline methods, including node-level and graph-level GNNs, by 19.8% over the strongest baseline. SubGNN performs exceptionally well on challenging biomedical datasets, where subgraphs have complex topology and even comprise multiple disconnected components.

    * Abstract: Peer review systems such as conference paper review often suffer from the issue of miscalibration. Previous works on peer review calibration usually only use the ordinal information or assume simplistic reviewer scoring functions such as linear functions. In practice, applications like academic conferences often rely on manual methods, such as open discussions, to mitigate miscalibration. It remains an important question to develop algorithms that can handle different types of miscalibrations based on available prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework, namely \emph{least square calibration} (LSC), for selecting top candidates from peer ratings. Our framework provably performs perfect calibration from noiseless linear scoring functions under mild assumptions, yet also provides competitive calibration results when the scoring function is from broader classes beyond linear functions and with arbitrary noise. On our synthetic dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the baseline which select top papers based on the highest average ratings.

    * Authors: Lingxiao Zhao, Neil Shah, Leman Akoglu
    * Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a dominant flavor of graph neural networks (GNNs) in recent years. Yet, MPNNs come with notable limitations; namely, they are at most as powerful as the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test in distinguishing graphs in a graph isomorphism testing frame-work. To this end, researchers have drawn inspiration from the k-WL hierarchy to develop more expressive GNNs. However, current k-WL-equivalent GNNs are not practical for even small values of k, as k-WL becomes combinatorially more complex as k grows. At the same time, several works have found great empirical success in graph learning tasks without highly expressive models, implying that chasing expressiveness with a “coarse-grained ruler” of expressivity like k-WL is often unneeded in practical tasks. To truly understand the expressiveness-complexity tradeoff, one desires a more “fine-grained ruler,” which can more gradually increase expressiveness. Our work puts forth such a proposal: Namely, we first propose the (k, c)(≤)-SETWL hierarchy with greatly reduced complexity from k-WL, achieved by moving from k-tuples of nodes to sets with ≤k nodes defined over ≤c connected components in the induced original graph. We show favorable theoretical results for this model in relation to k-WL, and concretize it via (k, c)(≤)-SETGNN, which is as expressive as (k, c)(≤)-SETWL. Our model is practical and progressively-expressive, increasing in power with k and c. We demonstrate effectiveness on several benchmark datasets, achieving several state-of-the-art results with runtime and memory usage applicable to practical graphs. We open source our implementation at https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/KCSetGNN.

    * Abstract: Post-hoc explanation techniques on graph neural networks (GNNs) provide economical solutions for opening the black-box graph models without model retraining. Many GNN explanation variants have achieved state-of-the-art explaining results on a diverse set of benchmarks, while they rarely provide theoretical analysis for their inherent properties and explanatory capability. In this work, we propose $\underline{\text{S}}$tructure-$\underline{\text{A}}$ware Shapley-based $\underline{\text{M}}$ultipiece $\underline{\text{E}}$xplanation (SAME) method to address the structure-aware feature interactions challenges for GNNs explanation. Specifically, SAME leverages an expansion-based Monte Carlo tree search to explore the multi-grained structure-aware connected substructure. Afterward, the explanation results are encouraged to be informative of the graph properties by optimizing the combination of distinct single substructures. With the consideration of fair feature interactions in the process of investigating multiple connected important substructures, the explanation provided by SAME has the potential to be as explainable as the theoretically optimal explanation obtained by the Shapley value within polynomial time. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks show that SAME improves the previous state-of-the-art fidelity performance by 12.9\% on BBBP, 7.01\% on MUTAG, 42.3\% on Graph-SST2, 38.9\% on Graph-SST5, 11.3\% on BA-2Motifs and 18.2\% on BA-Shapes under the same testing condition.

    * Authors: Pum Jun Kim, Yoojin Jang, Jisu Kim, Jaejun Yoo
    * Abstract: We propose a robust and reliable evaluation metric for generative models called Topological Precision and Recall (TopP&R, pronounced “topper”), which systematically estimates supports by retaining only topologically and statistically significant features with a certain level of confidence. Existing metrics, such as Inception Score (IS), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and various Precision and Recall (P&R) variants, rely heavily on support estimates derived from sample features. However, the reliability of these estimates has been overlooked, even though the quality of the evaluation hinges entirely on their accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that current methods not only fail to accurately assess sample quality when support estimation is unreliable, but also yield inconsistent results. In contrast, TopP&R reliably evaluates the sample quality and ensures statistical consistency in its results. Our theoretical and experimental findings reveal that TopP&R provides a robust evaluation, accurately capturing the true trend of change in samples, even in the presence of outliers and non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) perturbations where other methods result in inaccurate support estimations. To our knowledge, TopP&R is the first evaluation metric specifically focused on the robust estimation of supports, offering statistical consistency under noise conditions.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel scene text detection algorithm, Canny Text Detector, which takes advantage of the similarity between image edge and text for effective text localization with improved recall rate. As closely related edge pixels construct the structural information of an object, we observe that cohesive characters compose a meaningful word/sentence sharing similar properties such as spatial location, size, color, and stroke width regardless of language. However, prevalent scene text detection approaches have not fully utilized such similarity, but mostly rely on the characters classified with high confidence, leading to low recall rate. By exploiting the similarity, our approach can quickly and robustly localize a variety of texts. Inspired by the original Canny edge detector, our algorithm makes use of double threshold and hysteresis tracking to detect texts of low confidence. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art scene text detection methods in terms of detection rate.

    * Abstract: This paper concerns a theoretical approach that combines topological data analysis (TDA) and sheaf theory. Topological data analysis, a rising field in mathematics and computer science, concerns the shape of the data and has been proven effective in many scientific disciplines. Sheaf theory, a mathematics subject in algebraic geometry, provides a framework for describing the local consistency in geometric objects. Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main driving forces in TDA, and the idea is to track changes in geometric objects at different scales. The persistence diagram (PD) summarizes the information of PH in the form of a multi-set. While PD provides useful information about the underlying objects, it lacks fine relations about the local consistency of specific pairs of generators in PD, such as the merging relation between two connected components in the PH. The sheaf structure provides a novel point of view for describing the merging relation of local objects in PH. It is the goal of this paper to establish a theoretic framework that utilizes the sheaf theory to uncover finer information from the PH. We also show that the proposed theory can be applied to identify the merging relations of local objects in digital images.

    * Abstract: The quality of any tracking-by-assignment hinges on the accuracy of the foregoing target detection / segmentation step. In many kinds of images, errors in this first stage are unavoidable. These errors then propagate to, and corrupt, the tracking result. Our main contribution is the first probabilistic graphical model that can explicitly account for overand undersegmentation errors even when the number of tracking targets is unknown and when they may divide, as in cell cultures. The tracking model we present implements global consistency constraints for the number of targets comprised by each detection and is solved to global optimality on reasonably large 2D+t and 3D+t datasets. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of a postprocessing that allows to establish target identity even across occlusion / undersegmentation. The usefulness and efficiency of this new tracking method is demonstrated on three different and challenging 2D+t and 3D+t datasets from developmental biology.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel method for instance label segmentation of dense 3D voxel grids. We target volumetric scene representations, which have been acquired with depth sensors or multi-view stereo methods and which have been processed with semantic 3D reconstruction or scene completion methods. The main task is to learn shape information about individual object instances in order to accurately separate them, including connected and incompletely scanned objects. We solve the 3D instance-labeling problem with a multi-task learning strategy. The first goal is to learn an abstract feature embedding, which groups voxels with the same instance label close to each other while separating clusters with different instance labels from each other. The second goal is to learn instance information by densely estimating directional information of the instance's center of mass for each voxel. This is particularly useful to find instance boundaries in the clustering post-processing step, as well as, for scoring the segmentation quality for the first goal. Both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the viability and merits of our approach. In fact, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet 3D instance segmentation benchmark.

    * Abstract: Editing 3D models is a very challenging task, as it requires complex interactions with the 3D shape to reach the targeted design, while preserving the global consistency and plausibility of the shape. In this work, we present an intelligent and user-friendly 3D editing tool, where the edited model is constrained to lie onto a learned manifold of realistic shapes. Due to the topological variability of real 3D models, they often lie close to a disconnected manifold, which cannot be learned with a common learning algorithm. Therefore, our tool is based on a new deep learning model, DiscoNet, which extends 3D surface autoencoders in two ways. Firstly, our deep learning model uses several autoencoders to automatically learn each connected component of a disconnected manifold, without any supervision. Secondly, each autoencoder infers the output 3D surface by deforming a pre-learned 3D template specific to each connected component. Both advances translate into improved 3D synthesis, thus enhancing the quality of our 3D editing tool.

    * Abstract: Unsupervised visual representation learning has gained much attention from the computer vision community because of the recent achievement of contrastive learning. Most of the existing contrastive learning frameworks adopt the instance discrimination as the pretext task, which treating every single instance as a different class. However, such method will inevitably cause class collision problems, which hurts the quality of the learned representation. Motivated by this observation, we introduced a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework (WCL) to tackle this issue. Specifically, our proposed framework is based on two projection heads, one of which will perform the regular instance discrimination task. The other head will use a graph-based method to explore similar samples and generate a weak label, then perform a supervised contrastive learning task based on the weak label to pull the similar images closer. We further introduced a K-Nearest Neighbor based multi-crop strategy to expand the number of positive samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate WCL improves the quality of self-supervised representations across different datasets. Notably, we get a new state-of-the-art result for semi-supervised learning. With only 1% and 10% labeled examples, WCL achieves 65% and 72% ImageNet Top-1 Accuracy using ResNet50, which is even higher than SimCLRv2 with ResNet101.

    * Abstract: LiDAR panoptic segmentation is a newly proposed technical task for autonomous driving. In contrast to popular end-to-end deep learning solutions, we propose a hybrid method with an existing semantic segmentation network to extract semantic information and a traditional LiDAR point cloud cluster algorithm to split each instance object. We argue geometry-based traditional clustering algorithms are worth being considered by showing a state-of-the-art performance among all published end-to-end deep learning solutions on the panoptic segmentation leaderboard of the SemanticKITTI dataset. To our best knowledge, we are the first to attempt the point cloud panoptic segmentation with clustering algorithms. Therefore, instead of working on new models, we give a comprehensive technical survey in this paper by implementing four typical cluster methods and report their performances on the benchmark. Those four cluster methods are the most representative ones with real-time running speed. They are implemented with C++ in this paper and then wrapped as a python function for seamless integration with the existing deep learning frameworks. We release our code for peer researchers who might be interested in this problem here: https://github.com/placeforyiming/ICCVW21-LiDAR-Panoptic-Segmentation-TradiCV-Survey-of-Point-Cloud-Cluster

    * Abstract: In this paper, we derive theoretical bounds for the long-term influence of a node in an Independent Cascade Model (ICM). We relate these bounds to the spectral radius of a particular matrix and show that the behavior is sub-critical when this spectral radius is lower than 1. More specifically, we point out that, in general networks, the sub-critical regime behaves in O(sqrt(n)) where n is the size of the network, and that this upper bound is met for star-shaped networks. We apply our results to epidemiology and percolation on arbitrary networks, and derive a bound for the critical value beyond which a giant connected component arises. Finally, we show empirically the tightness of our bounds for a large family of networks.

    * Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental task in many data-mining and machine-learning pipelines. In particular, identifying a good hierarchical structure is at the same time a fundamental and challenging problem for several applications. The amount of data to analyze is increasing at an astonishing rate each day. Hence there is a need for new solutions to efficiently compute effective hierarchical clusterings on such huge data. The main focus of this paper is on minimum spanning tree (MST) based clusterings. In particular, we propose affinity, a novel hierarchical clustering based on Boruvka's MST algorithm. We prove certain theoretical guarantees for affinity (as well as some other classic algorithms) and show that in practice it is superior to several other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Furthermore, we present two MapReduce implementations for affinity. The first one works for the case where the input graph is dense and takes constant rounds. It is based on a Massively Parallel MST algorithm for dense graphs that improves upon the state-of-the-art algorithm of Lattanzi et al. (SPAA 2011). Our second algorithm has no assumption on the density of the input graph and finds the affinity clustering in $O(\log n)$ rounds using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs). We show experimentally that our algorithms are scalable for huge data sets, e.g., for graphs with trillions of edges.

    * Publisher: NeurIPS
    * Publication Date: `2019`
    * Authors: Boris Hanin, David Rolnick
    * Abstract: The success of deep networks has been attributed in part to their expressivity: per parameter, deep networks can approximate a richer class of functions than shallow networks. In ReLU networks, the number of activation patterns is one measure of expressivity; and the maximum number of patterns grows exponentially with the depth. However, recent work has showed that the practical expressivity of deep networks - the functions they can learn rather than express - is often far from the theoretical maximum. In this paper, we show that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is bounded by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. We show empirically that this bound, which is independent of the depth, is tight both at initialization and during training, even on memorization tasks that should maximize the number of activation patterns. Our work suggests that realizing the full expressivity of deep networks may not be possible in practice, at least with current methods.

    * Abstract: Multi-view subspace clustering aims to exploit a common affinity representation by means of self-expression. Plenty of works have been presented to boost the clustering performance, yet seldom considering the topological structure in data, which is crucial for clustering data on manifold. Orthogonal to existing works, in this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to explore the implied data manifold by learning the topological relationship between data points. Our model seamlessly integrates multiple affinity graphs into a consensus one with the topological relevance considered. Meanwhile, we manipulate the consensus graph by a connectivity constraint such that the connected components precisely indicate different clusters. Hence our model is able to directly obtain the final clustering result without reliance on any label discretization strategy as previous methods do. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, compared to the state-of-the-art competitors over the clustering performance.

We also formulate an ad hoc loss to efficiently learn from partial clustering data using this operation. We demonstrate its performance on several data sets for supervised and semi-supervised tasks.

    * Authors: Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel
    * Abstract: Counterfactual inference aims to answer retrospective "what if" questions and thus belongs to the most fine-grained type of inference in Pearl's causality ladder. Existing methods for counterfactual inference with continuous outcomes aim at point identification and thus make strong and unnatural assumptions about the underlying structural causal model. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and aim at partial counterfactual identification of continuous outcomes, i.e., when the counterfactual query resides in an ignorance interval with informative bounds. We prove that, in general, the ignorance interval of the counterfactual queries has non-informative bounds, already when functions of structural causal models are continuously differentiable. As a remedy, we propose a novel sensitivity model called Curvature Sensitivity Model. This allows us to obtain informative bounds by bounding the curvature of level sets of the functions. We further show that existing point counterfactual identification methods are special cases of our Curvature Sensitivity Model when the bound of the curvature is set to zero. We then propose an implementation of our Curvature Sensitivity Model in the form of a novel deep generative model, which we call Augmented Pseudo-Invertible Decoder. Our implementation employs (i) residual normalizing flows with (ii) variational augmentations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our Augmented Pseudo-Invertible Decoder. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first partial identification model for Markovian structural causal models with continuous outcomes.

    * Authors: Ranran Shen, Pan Peng
    * Abstract: We address the problem of designing a sublinear-time spectral clustering oracle for graphs that exhibit strong clusterability. Such graphs contain $k$ latent clusters, each characterized by a large inner conductance (at least $\varphi$) and a small outer conductance (at most $\varepsilon$). Our aim is to preprocess the graph to enable clustering membership queries, with the key requirement that both preprocessing and query answering should be performed in sublinear time, and the resulting partition should be consistent with a $k$-partition that is close to the ground-truth clustering. Previous oracles have relied on either a $\textrm{poly}(k)\log n$ gap between inner and outer conductances or exponential (in $k/\varepsilon$) preprocessing time. Our algorithm relaxes these assumptions, albeit at the cost of a slightly higher misclassification ratio. We also show that our clustering oracle is robust against a few random edge deletions. To validate our theoretical bounds, we conducted experiments on synthetic networks.

    * Abstract: The mainstream approach to structured prediction problems in computer vision is to learn an energy function such that the solution minimizes that function. At prediction time, this approach must solve an often-challenging optimization problem. Search-based methods provide an alternative that has the potential to achieve higher performance. These methods learn to control a search procedure that constructs and evaluates candidate solutions. The recently-developed HC-Search method has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in natural language processing, but mixed success when applied to vision problems. This paper studies whether HC-Search can achieve similarly competitive performance on basic vision tasks such as object detection, scene labeling, and monocular depth estimation, where the leading paradigm is energy minimization. To this end, we introduce a search operator suited to the vision domain that improves a candidate solution by probabilistically sampling likely object configurations in the scene from the hierarchical Berkeley segmentation. We complement this search operator by applying the DAgger algorithm to robustly train the search heuristic so it learns from its previous mistakes. Our evaluation shows that these improvements reduce the branching factor and search depth, and thus give a significant performance boost. Our state-of-the-art results on scene labeling and depth estimation suggest that HC-Search provides a suitable tool for learning and inference in vision.

    * Abstract: Face segmentation is the task of densely labeling pixels on the face according to their semantics. While current methods place an emphasis on developing sophisticated architectures, use conditional random fields for smoothness, or rather employ adversarial training, we follow an alternative path towards robust face segmentation and parsing. Occlusions, along with other parts of the face, have a proper structure that needs to be propagated in the model during training. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that treat face segmentation as an independent pixel prediction problem, we argue instead that it should hold highly correlated outputs within the same object pixels. We thereby offer a novel learning mechanism to enforce structure in the prediction via consensus, guided by a robust loss function that forces pixel objects to be consistent with each other. Our face parser is trained by transferring knowledge from another model, yet it encourages spatial consistency while fitting the labels. Different than current practice, our method enjoys pixel-wise predictions, yet paves the way for fewer artifacts, less sparse masks, and spatially coherent outputs.

Rather painstakingly annotate segmentation masks, we observe people in realistic video data. We show that pairing epipolar geometry with modern optical flow produces simple and effective pseudo-labels for grouping. Given people segmentations, we can further associate pixels with hands to understand contact. Our system achieves competitive results on hand and hand-held object tasks.

    * Abstract: Representing a 3D shape with a set of primitives can aid perception of structure, improve robotic object manipulation, and enable editing, stylization, and compression of 3D shapes. Existing methods either use simple parametric primitives or learn a generative shape space of parts. Both have limitations: parametric primitives lead to coarse approximations, while learned parts offer too little control over the decomposition. We instead propose to decompose shapes using a library of 3D parts provided by the user, giving full control over the choice of parts. The library can contain parts with high-quality geometry that are suitable for a given category, resulting in meaningful decom- positions with clean geometry. The type of decomposition can also be controlled through the choice of parts in the library. Our method works via a unsupervised approach that iteratively retrieves parts from the library and refines their placements. We show that this approach gives higher reconstruction accuracy and more desirable decompositions than existing approaches. Additionally, we show how the decom- position can be controlled through the part library by using different part libraries to reconstruct the same shapes.

    * Abstract: Flow analysis of crowd and traffic videos is an important video surveillance task. In this work, we propose an algorithm for long-term flow segmentation and dominant flow extraction in traffic videos. Each flow segment is a temporal sequence of image segments indicating the motion of a vehicle in the camera view. This flow segmentation is done in the framework of Conditional Random Fields using motion and color features. We also propose a distance measure between any two flow segments based on Dynamic Time Warping and use this distance for clustering the flow segments into dominant flows. We then model each dominant flow by generating a representative flow segment, which is the mean of all the time-warped flow segments belonging to its cluster. Using these dominant flow models, we perform path prediction for the vehicles entering the view and detect anomalous motions. Experimental evaluation on a diverse set of challenging traffic videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: Retinal vessels identification plays a critical role in computer-aided diagnosis and analysis of fundus images. While Deep-Learning-based segmentation methods have shown remarkable performances in handling detailed and pathological fundus, they produce disconnected components whereas retinal vessels are a connected structure. In this work, we developed a post-processing pipeline to ensure a connected structure for the retinal vessels networks. The proposed pipeline named VNR for Vessels Network Retrieval, generates segmentations with a single connected component (CC). This is performed by removing artifacts that are pixels-miss-classified as retinal vessels, and by reconnecting branches that are well-classified but disconnected. By retrieving the structural coherence in the retinal vessels networks, we enable measurements such as vessels length, tortuosity and depth of the vessels tree structure in a more reliable manner. We evaluate our results using pixel-wise and structural metrics, comparing against manually labelled groundtruth. Before applying VNR the predicted segmentations had an average Dice score of 0.839 with 174 CCs. As a result, 173 CCs need to be deleted or reconnected. After applying VNR, the segmentations have an average Dice score of 0.840 with only 1 CC. VNR is thus able to retrieve the connected structure of the retinal vessels networks while also keeping or increasing pixel information.

    * Abstract: A video summary is a sequence of still pictures that represent the content of a video in such a way that the respective target group is rapidly provided with concise information about the content, while the essential message of the original video is preserved. In this paper, we present VGRAPH, a simple yet effective video summarization approach that utilizes both color and texture features. This approach is based on partitioning the video into shots by utilizing the color features, and extracting video key frames using a nearest neighbor graph built from the texture features of the shots representative frames. Also, this paper introduces and illustrates an enhanced evaluation method based on color and texture matching. Video summaries generated by VGRAPH are compared with summaries generated by others found in the literature and the ground truth summaries. Experimental results indicate that the video summaries generated by VGRAPH have a higher quality than others.

    * Abstract: Modern deep neural networks have achieved great successes in medical image analysis. However, the features captured by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers tend to be optimized for pixel intensities and neglect key anatomical structures such as connected components and loops. In this paper, we propose a persistent homology guided approach (PHG-Net) that explores topological features of objects for medical image classification. For an input image, we first compute its cubical persistence diagram and extract topological features into a vector representation using a small neural network (called the PH module). The extracted topological features are then incorporated into the feature map generated by CNN or Transformer for feature fusion. The PH module is lightweight and capable of integrating topological features into any CNN or Transformer architectures in an end-to-end fashion. We evaluate our PHG-Net on three public datasets and demonstrate its considerable improvements on the target classification tasks over state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: Theoretical analyses for graph learning methods often assume a complete observation of the input graph. Such an assumption might not be useful for handling any-size graphs due to the scalability issues in practice. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for graph classification problems in the partial observation setting (i.e., subgraph samplings). Equipped with insights from graph limit theory, we propose a new graph classification model that works on a randomly sampled subgraph and a novel topology to characterize the representability of the model. Our theoretical framework contributes a theoretical validation of mini-batch learning on graphs and leads to new learning-theoretic results on generalization bounds as well as size-generalizability without assumptions on the input.

    * Abstract: Most of the existing GNNs can be modeled via the Uniform Message Passing framework. This framework considers all the attributes of each node in its entirety, shares the uniform propagation weights along each edge, and focuses on the uniform weight learning. The design of this framework possesses two prerequisites, the simplification of homophily and heterophily to the node-level property and the ignorance of attribute differences. Unfortunately, different attributes possess diverse characteristics. In this paper, the network homophily rate defined with respect to the node labels is extended to attribute homophily rate by taking the attributes as weak labels. Based on this attribute homophily rate, we propose a Diverse Message Passing (DMP) framework, which specifies every attribute propagation weight on each edge. Besides, we propose two specific strategies to significantly reduce the computational complexity of DMP to prevent the overfitting issue. By investigating the spectral characteristics, existing spectral GNNs are actually equivalent to a degenerated version of DMP. From the perspective of numerical optimization, we provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate DMP's powerful representation ability and the ability of alleviating the over-smoothing issue. Evaluations on various real networks demonstrate the superiority of our DMP on handling the networks with heterophily and alleviating the over-smoothing issue, compared to the existing state-of-the-arts.

    * Abstract: Topological features based on persistent homology capture high-order structural information so as to augment graph neural network methods. However, computing extended persistent homology summaries remains slow for large and dense graphs and can be a serious bottleneck for the learning pipeline. Inspired by recent success in neural algorithmic reasoning, we propose a novel graph neural network to estimate extended persistence diagrams (EPDs) on graphs efficiently. Our model is built on algorithmic insights, and benefits from better supervision and closer alignment with the EPD computation algorithm. We validate our method with convincing empirical results on approximating EPDs and downstream graph representation learning tasks. Our method is also efficient; on large and dense graphs, we accelerate the computation by nearly 100 times.

    * Authors: Xinyi Wu, Amir Ajorlou, Zihui Wu, Ali Jadbabaie
    * Abstract: Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric, state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.

    * Abstract: Laser range sensors are often demanded to mount on a moving platform for achieving the good efficiency of 3D reconstruction. However, such moving systems often suffer from the difficulty of matching the distorted range scans. In this paper, we propose novel 3D features which can be robustly extracted and matched even for the distorted 3D surface captured by a moving system. Our feature extraction employs Morse theory to construct Morse functions which capture the critical points approximately invariant to the 3D surface distortion. Then for each critical point, we extract support regions with the maximally stable region defined by extremal region or disconnectivity. Our feature description is designed as two steps: 1) we normalize the detected local regions to canonical shapes for robust matching; 2) we encode each key point with multiple vectors at different Morse function values. In experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed 3D features achieve substantially better performance for distorted surface matching than the state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of perceiving the hidden or occluded geometry of the scene depicted in any given RGBD image. Unlike other image labeling problems such as image segmentation where each pixel needs to be assigned a single label, layered decomposition requires us to assign multiple labels to pixels. We propose a novel "Occlusion-CRF" model that allows for the integration of sophisticated priors to regularize the solution space and enables the automatic inference of the layer decomposition. We use a generalization of the Fusion Move algorithm to perform Maximum a Posterior (MAP) inference on the model that can handle the large label sets needed to represent multiple surface assignments to each pixel. We have evaluated the proposed model and the inference algorithm on many RGBD images of cluttered indoor scenes. Our experiments show that not only is our model able to explain occlusions but it also enables automatic inpainting of occluded/invisible surfaces.

    * Authors: Maggie Wigness, John G. Rogers III
    * Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised semantic scene labeling approach that continuously learns and adapts semantic models discovered within a data stream. While closely related to unsupervised video segmentation, our algorithm is not designed to be an early video processing strategy that produces coherent over-segmentations, but instead, to directly learn higher-level semantic concepts. This is achieved with an ensemble-based approach, where each learner clusters data from a local window in the data stream. Overlapping local windows are processed and encoded in a graph structure to create a label mapping across windows and reconcile the labelings to reduce unsupervised learning noise. Additionally, we iteratively learn a merging threshold criteria from observed data similarities to automatically determine the number of learned labels without human provided parameters. Experiments show that our approach semantically labels video streams with a high degree of accuracy, and achieves a better balance of under and over-segmentation entropy than existing video segmentation algorithms given similar numbers of label outputs.

    * Abstract: Action segmentation refers to inferring boundaries of semantically consistent visual concepts in videos and is an important requirement for many video understanding tasks. For this and other video understanding tasks, supervised approaches have achieved encouraging performance but require a high volume of detailed, frame-level, annotations. We present a fully automatic and unsupervised approach for segmenting actions in a video that does not require any training. Our proposal is an effective temporally-weighted hierarchical clustering algorithm that can group semantically consistent frames of the video. The main finding is that representing a video with a 1-nearest neighbor graph by taking into account the time progression is sufficient to form semantically and temporally consistent clusters of frames where each cluster may represent some action in the video. Additionally, we establish strong unsupervised baselines for action segmentation and show significant performance improvements over published unsupervised methods on five challenging action segmentation datasets.

    * Abstract: Synthesizing 3D human avatars interacting realistically with a scene is an important problem with applications in AR/VR, video games, and robotics. Towards this goal, we address the task of generating a virtual human -- hands and full body -- grasping everyday objects. Existing methods approach this problem by collecting a 3D dataset of humans interacting with objects and training on this data. However, 1) these methods do not generalize to different object positions and orientations or to the presence of furniture in the scene, and 2) the diversity of their generated full-body poses is very limited. In this work, we address all the above challenges to generate realistic, diverse full-body grasps in everyday scenes without requiring any 3D full-body grasping data. Our key insight is to leverage the existence of both full-body pose and hand-grasping priors, composing them using 3D geometrical constraints to obtain full-body grasps. We empirically validate that these constraints can generate a variety of feasible human grasps that are superior to baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Notably, supervision is done using low cost center point annotations. The approach, named Triple-S Network, incorporates a three-part loss with shape priors to promote better fitting to objects of known shape typical in agricultural scenes. Our results improve overall segmentation performance by more than 6.74% and counting results by 22.91% when compared to state-of-the-art. To train and evaluate the network, we have collected the CRanberry Aerial Imagery Dataset (CRAID), the largest dataset of aerial drone imagery from cranberry fields.

In this paper we propose a fast one-dimensional approach for automatic document layout analysis considering text, figures and tables based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). We take advantage of the inherently one-dimensional pattern observed in text and table blocks to reduce the dimension analysis from bi-dimensional documents images to 1D signatures, improving significantly the overall performance: we present considerably faster execution times and more compact data usage with no loss in overall accuracy if compared with a classical bi-dimensional CNN approach.

    * Abstract: A practical garment digitisation should be efficient and robust to minimise the cost of processing a large volume of garments manufactured in every season. In addition, the quality of a texture map needs to be high to deliver a better user experience of VR/AR applications using garment models such as digital wardrobe or virtual fitting room. To address this, we propose a novel pipeline for fast, low-cost, and robust 3D garment digitisation with minimal human involvement. The proposed system is simply configured with a commodity RGB-D sensor (e.g. Kinect) and a rotating platform where a mannequin is placed to put on a target garment. Since a conventional reconstruction pipeline such as Kinect Fusion (KF) tends to fail to track the correct camera pose under fast rotation, we modelled the camera motion and fed this as a guidance of the ICP process in KF. The proposed method is also designed to produce a high-quality texture map by stitching the best views from a single rotation, and a modified shape from silhouettes algorithm has been developed to extract a garment model from a mannequin.

    * Abstract: A cluster tree provides an intuitive summary of a density function that reveals essential structure about the high-density clusters. The true cluster tree is estimated from a finite sample from an unknown true density. This paper addresses the basic question of quantifying our uncertainty by assessing the statistical significance of different features of an empirical cluster tree. We first study a variety of metrics that can be used to compare different trees, analyzing their properties and assessing their suitability for our inference task. We then propose methods to construct and summarize confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree. We introduce a partial ordering on cluster trees which we use to prune some of the statistically insignificant features of the empirical tree, yielding interpretable and parsimonious cluster trees. Finally, we provide a variety of simulations to illustrate our proposed methods and furthermore demonstrate their utility in the analysis of a Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) data set.

    * Abstract: Many dynamic processes, including common scenarios in robotic control and reinforcement learning (RL), involve a set of interacting subprocesses. Though the subprocesses are not independent, their interactions are often sparse, and the dynamics at any given time step can often be decomposed into locally independent} causal mechanisms. Such local causal structures can be leveraged to improve the sample efficiency of sequence prediction and off-policy reinforcement learning. We formalize this by introducing local causal models (LCMs), which are induced from a global causal model by conditioning on a subset of the state space. We propose an approach to inferring these structures given an object-oriented state representation, as well as a novel algorithm for Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CoDA). CoDA uses local structures and an experience replay to generate counterfactual experiences that are causally valid in the global model. We find that CoDA significantly improves the performance of RL agents in locally factored tasks, including the batch-constrained and goal-conditioned settings.

    * Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is a fundamental problem in organic synthesis, where the task is to identify precursor molecules that can be used to synthesize a target molecule. A key consideration in building neural models for this task is aligning model design with strategies adopted by chemists. Building on this viewpoint, this paper introduces a graph-based approach that capitalizes on the idea that the graph topology of precursor molecules is largely unaltered during a chemical reaction. The model first predicts the set of graph edits transforming the target into incomplete molecules called synthons. Next, the model learns to expand synthons into complete molecules by attaching relevant leaving groups. This decomposition simplifies the architecture, making its predictions more interpretable, and also amenable to manual correction. Our model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 53.7%, outperforming previous template-free and semi-template-based methods.

    * Abstract: We introduce a new Collaborative Causal Discovery problem, through which we model a common scenario in which we have multiple independent entities each with their own causal graph, and the goal is to simultaneously learn all these causal graphs. We study this problem without the causal sufficiency assumption, using Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAG) to model the causal graphs, and assuming that we have the ability to actively perform independent single vertex (or atomic) interventions on the entities. If the $M$ underlying (unknown) causal graphs of the entities satisfy a natural notion of clustering, we give algorithms that leverage this property and recovers all the causal graphs using roughly logarithmic in $M$ number of atomic interventions per entity. These are significantly fewer than $n$ atomic interventions per entity required to learn each causal graph separately, where $n$ is the number of observable nodes in the causal graph. We complement our results with a lower bound and discuss various extensions of our collaborative setting.

    * Abstract: Selecting subsets of features that differentiate between two conditions is a key task in a broad range of scientific domains. In many applications, the features of interest form clusters with similar effects on the data at hand. To recover such clusters we develop DiSC, a data-driven approach for detecting groups of features that differentiate between conditions. For each condition, we construct a graph whose nodes correspond to the features and whose weights are functions of the similarity between them for that condition. We then apply a spectral approach to compute subsets of nodes whose connectivity pattern differs significantly between the condition-specific feature graphs. On the theoretical front, we analyze our approach with a toy example based on the stochastic block model. We evaluate DiSC on a variety of datasets, including MNIST, hyperspectral imaging, simulated scRNA-seq and task fMRI, and demonstrate that DiSC uncovers features that better differentiate between conditions compared to competing methods.

    * Abstract: Correlation clustering is a central problem in unsupervised learning, with applications spanning community detection, duplicate detection, automated labeling and many more. In the correlation clustering problem one receives as input a set of nodes and for each node a list of co-clustering preferences, and the goal is to output a clustering that minimizes the disagreement with the specified nodes' preferences. In this paper, we introduce a simple and computationally efficient algorithm for the correlation clustering problem with provable privacy guarantees. Our additive error is stronger than those obtained in prior work and is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors for fixed privacy parameters.

    * Abstract: Despite recent success in large language model (LLM) reasoning, LLMs struggle with hierarchical multi-step reasoning tasks like generating complex programs. For these tasks, humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually. We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs. With Parsel, we automatically decompose algorithmic tasks into hierarchical natural language function descriptions and then search over combinations of possible function implementations using tests. We show that Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis and robotic planning. We find that, using Parsel, LLMs solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in pass rates over 75\% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex, while often using a smaller sample budget. Moreover, with automatically generated tests, we find that Parsel can improve the state-of-the-art pass@1 performance on HumanEval from 67\% to 85\%. We also find that LLM-generated robotic plans using Parsel are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans. Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers. We release our code at https://github.com/ezelikman/parsel.

    * Abstract: Individual preference (IP) stability, introduced by Ahmadi et al. (ICML 2022), is a natural clustering objective inspired by stability and fairness constraints. A clustering is $\alpha$-IP stable if the average distance of every data point to its own cluster is at most $\alpha$ times the average distance to any other cluster. Unfortunately, determining if a dataset admits a $1$-IP stable clustering is NP-Hard. Moreover, before this work, it was unknown if an $o(n)$-IP stable clustering always exists, as the prior state of the art only guaranteed an $O(n)$-IP stable clustering. We close this gap in understanding and show that an $O(1)$-IP stable clustering always exists for general metrics, and we give an efficient algorithm which outputs such a clustering. We also introduce generalizations of IP stability beyond average distance and give efficient near optimal algorithms in the cases where we consider the maximum and minimum distances within and between clusters.

    * Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning the large-scale Gaussian graphical models that are multivariate totally positive of order two ($\text{MTP}_2$). By introducing the concept of bridge, which commonly exists in large-scale sparse graphs, we show that the entire problem can be equivalently optimized through (1) several smaller-scaled sub-problems induced by a \emph{bridge-block decomposition} on the thresholded sample covariance graph and (2) a set of explicit solutions on entries corresponding to \emph{bridges}. From practical aspect, this simple and provable discipline can be applied to break down a large problem into small tractable ones, leading to enormous reduction on the computational complexity and substantial improvements for all existing algorithms. The synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate that our proposed method presents a significant speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

    * Abstract: We propose a new approach for semantic segmentation of 3D city models. Starting from an SfM reconstruction of a street-side scene, we perform classification and facade splitting purely in 3D, obviating the need for slow image-based semantic segmentation methods. We show that a properly trained pure-3D approach produces high quality labelings, with significant speed benefits (20x faster) allowing us to analyze entire streets in a matter of minutes. Additionally, if speed is not of the essence, the 3D labeling can be combined with the results of a state-of-the-art 2D classifier, further boosting the performance. Further, we propose a novel facade separation based on semantic nuances between facades. Finally, inspired by the use of architectural principles for 2D facade labeling, we propose new 3D-specific principles and an efficient optimization scheme based on an integer quadratic programming formulation.

    * Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we address the problem of object discovery in time-varying, large-scale image collections. A core part of our approach is a novel Limited Horizon Minimum Spanning Tree (LH-MST) structure that closely approximates the Minimum Spanning Tree at a small fraction of the latter's computational cost. Our proposed tree structure can be created in a local neighborhood of the matching graph during image retrieval and can be efficiently updated whenever the image database is extended. We show how the LH-MST can be used within both single-link hierarchical agglomer- ative clustering and the Iconoid Shift framework for object discovery in image collections, resulting in significant efficiency gains and making both approaches capable of incremental clustering with online updates. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 500k images from the city of Paris and compare its results to the batch version of both clustering algorithms.

    * Abstract: Segmenting an image into multiple components is a central task in computer vision. In many practical scenarios, prior knowledge about plausible components is available. Incorporating such prior knowledge into models and algorithms for image segmentation is highly desirable, yet can be non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a new approach that allows, for the first time, to constrain some or all components of a segmentation to have convex shapes. Specifically, we extend the Minimum Cost Multicut Problem by a class of constraints that enforce convexity. To solve instances of this NP-hard integer linear program to optimality, we separate the proposed constraints in the branch-and-cut loop of a state-of-the-art ILP solver. Results on photographs and micrographs demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach as well as its advantages over the state-of-the-art heuristic.

    * Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality yet largely preventable, but the key to prevention is to identify at risk individuals before adverse events. For predicting individual CVD risk, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a noninvasive ultrasound method, has proven to be valuable, offering several advantages over CT coronary artery calcium score. However, each CIMT examination includes several ultrasound videos, and interpreting each of these CIMT videos involves three operations: (1) select three end-diastolic ultrasound frames (EUF) in the video, (2) localize a region of interest (ROI) in each selected frame, and (3) trace the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface in each ROI to measure CIMT. These operations are tedious, laborious, and time consuming, a serious limitation that hinders the widespread utilization of CIMT in clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new system to automate CIMT video interpretation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The superior performance is attributable to our unified framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) coupled with our informative image representation and effective post-processing of the CNN outputs, which are uniquely designed for each of the above three operations.

    * Abstract: The notion of a Fast Moving Object (FMO), i.e. an object that moves over a distance exceeding its size within the exposure time, is introduced. FMOs may, and typically do, rotate with high angular speed. FMOs are very common in sports videos, but are not rare elsewhere. In a single frame, such objects are often barely visible and appear as semitransparent streaks. A method for the detection and tracking of FMOs is proposed. The method consists of three distinct algorithms, which form an efficient localization pipeline that operates successfully in a broad range of conditions. We show that it is possible to recover the appearance of the object and its axis of rotation, despite its blurred appearance. The proposed method is evaluated on a new annotated dataset. The results show that existing trackers are inadequate for the problem of FMO localization and a new approach is required. Two applications of localization, temporal superresolution and highlighting, are presented.

    * Abstract: We propose a simple but effective tracking-by-segmentation algorithm using Absorbing Markov Chain (AMC) on superpixel segmentation, where target state is estimated by a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches, and target segmentation is propagated to subsequent frames in a recursive manner. Our algorithm constructs a graph for AMC using the superpixels identified in two consecutive frames, where background superpixels in the previous frame correspond to absorbing vertices while all other superpixels create transient ones. The weight of each edge depends on the similarity of scores in the end superpixels, which are learned by support vector regression. Once graph construction is completed, target segmentation is estimated using the absorption time of each superpixel. The proposed tracking algorithm achieves substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art segmentation-based tracking techniques in multiple challenging datasets.

    * Abstract: Common visual recognition tasks such as classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are rapidly reaching maturity, and given the recent rate of progress, it is not unreasonable to conjecture that techniques for many of these problems will approach human levels of performance in the next few years. In this paper we look to the future: what is the next frontier in visual recognition? We offer one possible answer to this question. We propose a detailed image annotation that captures information beyond the visible pixels and requires complex reasoning about full scene structure. Specifically, we create an amodal segmentation of each image: the full extent of each region is marked, not just the visible pixels. Annotators outline and name all salient regions in the image and specify a partial depth order. The result is a rich scene structure, including visible and occluded portions of each region, figure-ground edge information, semantic labels, and object overlap. We create two datasets for semantic amodal segmentation. First, we label 500 images in the BSDS dataset with multiple annotators per image, allowing us to study the statistics of human annotations. We show that the proposed full scene annotation is surprisingly consistent between annotators, including for regions and edges. Second, we annotate 5000 images from COCO. This larger dataset allows us to explore a number of algorithmic ideas for amodal segmentation and depth ordering. We introduce novel metrics for these tasks, and along with our strong baselines, define concrete new challenges for the community.

    * Abstract: While recent supervised methods for reference-based object counting continue to improve the performance on benchmark datasets they have to rely on small datasets due to the cost associated with manually annotating dozens of objects in images. We propose UnCounTR a model that can learn this task without requiring any manual annotations. To this end we construct "Self-Collages" images with various pasted objects as training samples that provide a rich learning signal covering arbitrary object types and counts. Our method builds on existing unsupervised representations and segmentation techniques to successfully demonstrate for the first time the ability of reference-based counting without manual supervision. Our experiments show that our method not only outperforms simple baselines and generic models such as FasterRCNN and DETR but also matches the performance of supervised counting models in some domains.

    * Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation is cutting-edge for its ability to segment 3D instances without predefined categories. However progress in 3D lags behind its 2D counterpart due to limited annotated 3D data. To address this recent works first generate 2D open-vocabulary masks through 2D models and then merge them into 3D instances based on metrics calculated between two neighboring frames. In contrast to these local metrics we propose a novel metric view consensus rate to enhance the utilization of multi-view observations. The key insight is that two 2D masks should be deemed part of the same 3D instance if a significant number of other 2D masks from different views contain both these two masks. Using this metric as edge weight we construct a global mask graph where each mask is a node. Through iterative clustering of masks showing high view consensus we generate a series of clusters each representing a distinct 3D instance. Notably our model is training-free. Through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets including ScanNet++ ScanNet200 and MatterPort3D we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation.

    * Abstract: Dimensionality reduction problem is stated as finding a mapping from the original to the low-dimensional space while preserving some relevant properties of the data. We formulate topology-preserving dimensionality reduction as finding the optimal orthogonal projection to the lower-dimensional subspace which minimizes discrepancy between persistent diagrams of the original data and the projection. This generalizes the classic projection pursuit algorithm which was originally designed to preserve the number of clusters, i.e. the 0-order topological invariant of the data. Our approach further allows to preserve k-th order invariants within the principled framework. We further pose the resulting optimization problem as the Riemannian optimization problem which allows for a natural and efficient solution.

    * Abstract: Eye movement studies have confirmed that overt attention is highly biased towards faces and text regions in images. In this paper we explore a novel problem of predicting face and text regions in images using eye tracking data from multiple subjects. The problem is challenging as we aim to predict the semantics (face/text/background) only from eye tracking data without utilizing any image information. The proposed algorithm spatially clusters eye tracking data obtained in an image into different coherent groups and subsequently models the likelihood of the clusters containing faces and text using a fully connected Markov Random Field (MRF). Given the eye tracking data from a test image, it predicts potential face/head (humans, dogs and cats) and text locations reliably. Furthermore, the approach can be used to select regions of interest for further analysis by object detectors for faces and text. The hybrid eye position/object detector approach achieves better detection performance and reduced computation time compared to using only the object detection algorithm. We also present a new eye tracking dataset on 300 images selected from ICDAR, Street-view, Flickr and Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset from 15 subjects.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we approach the problem of segmentation-free query-by-string word spotting for handwritten documents. In other words, we use methods inspired from computer vision and machine learning to search for words in large collections of digitized manuscripts. In particular, we are interested in historical handwritten texts, which are often far more challenging than modern printed documents. This task is important, as it provides people with a way to quickly find what they are looking for in large collections that are tedious and difficult to read manually. To this end, we introduce an end-to-end trainable model based on deep neural networks that we call Ctrl-F-Net. Given a full manuscript page, the model simultaneously generates region proposals, and embeds these into a distributed word embedding space, where searches are performed. We evaluate the model on common benchmarks for handwritten word spotting, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art segmentation-free approaches by a large margin, and in some cases even segmentation-based approaches. One interesting real-life application of our approach is to help historians to find and count specific words in court records that are related to women's sustenance activities and division of labor. We provide promising preliminary experiments that validate our method on this task.

    * Abstract: In digital pathology, both detection and classification of cells are important for automatic diagnostic and prognostic tasks. Classifying cells into subtypes, such as tumor cells, lymphocytes or stromal cells is particularly challenging. Existing methods focus on morphological appearance of individual cells, whereas in practice pathologists often infer cell classes through their spatial context. In this paper, we propose a novel method for both detection and classification that explicitly incorporates spatial contextual information. We use the spatial statistical function to describe local density in both a multi-class and a multi-scale manner. Through representation learning and deep clustering techniques, we learn advanced cell representation with both appearance and spatial context. On various benchmarks, our method achieves better performance than state-of-the-arts, especially on the classification task.

    * Abstract: Fine-grained 3D segmentation is an important task in 3D object understanding, especially in applications such as intelligent manufacturing or parts analysis for 3D objects. However, many challenges involved in such problem are yet to be solved, such as i) interpreting the complex structures located in different regions for 3D objects; ii) capturing fine-grained structures with sufficient topology correctness. Current deep learning and graph machine learning methods fail to tackle such challenges and thus provide inferior performance in fine-grained 3D analysis. In this work, methods in topological data analysis are incorporated with geometric deep learning model for the task of fine-grained segmentation for 3D objects. We propose a novel neural network model called Persistent Homology based Graph Convolution Network (PHGCN), which i) integrates persistent homology into graph convolution network to capture multi-scale structural information that can accurately represent complex structures for 3D objects; ii) applies a novel Persistence Diagram Loss that provides sufficient topology correctness for segmentation over the fine-grained structures. Extensive experiments on fine-grained 3D segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed PHGCN model and show significant improvements over current state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: From the simple measurement of tissue attributes in pathology workflow to designing an explainable diagnostic/prognostic AI tool, access to accurate semantic segmentation of tissue regions in histology images is a prerequisite. However, delineating different tissue regions manually is a laborious, time-consuming and costly task that requires expert knowledge. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art automatic deep learning models for semantic segmentation require lots of annotated training data and there are only a limited number of tissue region annotated images publicly available. To obviate this issue in computational pathology projects and collect large-scale region annotations efficiently, we propose an efficient interactive segmentation network that requires minimum input from the user to accurately annotate different tissue types in the histology image. The user is only required to draw a simple squiggle inside each region of interest so it will be used as the guiding signal for the model. To deal with the complex appearance and amorph geometry of different tissue regions we introduce several automatic and minimalistic guiding signal generation techniques that help the model to become robust against the variation in the user input. By experimenting on a dataset of breast cancer images, we show that not only does our proposed method speed up the interactive annotation process, it can also outperform the existing automatic and interactive region segmentation models.

    * Abstract: Roots and their temporal development play an important role in plant research. Over the decades image-based monitoring of root growth has become a key methodology in this research field. The growing amount of image data is often tackled with automatic image analysis approaches. In particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) recently gained increasing interest for root segmentation. This segmentation of roots is usually only the first step of an analysis pipeline and needs to be supplemented by topological reconstruction of the complete root system architecture. In this paper we present a comprehensive study of different CNN architectures, loss functions and parameter settings for root image segmentation. In addition, we show how main and lateral roots can be identified based on the skeletons of segmented root components as a first step towards topological reconstruction of root system architecture. We present quantitative and qualitative results on data released in the course of the CVPPA Arabidopsis Root Segmentation Challenge 2021.

    * Abstract: We address the problem of reconstructing road networks as undirected graphs over large geographic regions in cold start scenarios where neither the preliminary graph nor any on-road trajectory information is available. The goal of this paper is to transform bimodal aerial data in the form of 3-dimensional Lidar scans and high resolution images into road network graphs. We use a fully convolutional architecture that fuses the two datasets by reducing the disparity in their modalities to segment out roads. We then apply a simple, disk-packing based algorithm that covers the segmented regions with a minimal set of variably sized disks, connect the intersecting disks and use a provable curve reconstruction algorithm to obtain the road network graph. We show that our method is better at removing outliers and gives improved connectivity and topological accuracy than the existing state of the art thinning based method.

    * Abstract: We tackle the problem of analyzing and retrieving technical drawings. First, we introduce DeepPatent, a new large-scale dataset for recognition and retrieval of design patent drawings. The dataset provides more than 350,000 design patent drawings for the purpose of image retrieval. Unlike existing datasets, DeepPatent provides fine-grained image retrieval associations within the collection of drawings and does not rely on cross-domain associations for supervision. We develop a baseline deep learning models, named PatentNet, based on best practices for training retrieval models for static images. We demonstrate the superior performance of PatentNet when trained on our fine-grained associations of DeepPatent against other deep learning approaches and classic computer vision descriptors, such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), on DeepPatent. With the introduction of this new dataset, and benchmark algorithms, we demonstrate that the analysis and retrieval of line drawings remains an open challenge in computer vision; and that patent drawing retrieval provides a concrete testbench to spur research.

    * Abstract: In this work we develop a theory of hierarchical clustering for graphs. Our modelling assumption is that graphs are sampled from a graphon, which is a powerful and general model for generating graphs and analyzing large networks. Graphons are a far richer class of graph models than stochastic blockmodels, the primary setting for recent progress in the statistical theory of graph clustering. We define what it means for an algorithm to produce the ``correct" clustering, give sufficient conditions in which a method is statistically consistent, and provide an explicit algorithm satisfying these properties.

    * Abstract: The Euclidean k-means problem is arguably the most widely-studied clustering problem in machine learning. While the k-means objective is NP-hard in the worst-case, practitioners have enjoyed remarkable success in applying heuristics like Lloyd's algorithm for this problem. To address this disconnect, we study the following question: what properties of real-world instances will enable us to design efficient algorithms and prove guarantees for finding the optimal clustering? We consider a natural notion called additive perturbation stability that we believe captures many practical instances of Euclidean k-means clustering. Stable instances have unique optimal k-means solutions that does not change even when each point is perturbed a little (in Euclidean distance). This captures the property that k-means optimal solution should be tolerant to measurement errors and uncertainty in the points. We design efficient algorithms that provably recover the optimal clustering for instances that are additive perturbation stable. When the instance has some additional separation, we can design a simple, efficient algorithm with provable guarantees that is also robust to outliers. We also complement these results by studying the amount of stability in real datasets, and demonstrating that our algorithm performs well on these benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Humans have a remarkable capacity to understand the physical dynamics of objects in their environment, flexibly capturing complex structures and interactions at multiple levels of detail. Inspired by this ability, we propose a hierarchical particle-based object representation that covers a wide variety of types of three-dimensional objects, including both arbitrary rigid geometrical shapes and deformable materials. We then describe the Hierarchical Relation Network (HRN), an end-to-end differentiable neural network based on hierarchical graph convolution, that learns to predict physical dynamics in this representation. Compared to other neural network baselines, the HRN accurately handles complex collisions and nonrigid deformations, generating plausible dynamics predictions at long time scales in novel settings, and scaling to large scene configurations. These results demonstrate an architecture with the potential to form the basis of next-generation physics predictors for use in computer vision, robotics, and quantitative cognitive science.

    * Abstract: In real-world online web systems, multiple users usually arrive sequentially into the system. For applications like click fraud and fake reviews, some users can maliciously perform corrupted (disrupted) behaviors to trick the system. Therefore, it is crucial to design efficient online learning algorithms to robustly learn from potentially corrupted user behaviors and accurately identify the corrupted users in an online manner. Existing works propose bandit algorithms robust to adversarial corruption. However, these algorithms are designed for a single user, and cannot leverage the implicit social relations among multiple users for more efficient learning. Moreover, none of them consider how to detect corrupted users online in the multiple-user scenario. In this paper, we present an important online learning problem named LOCUD to learn and utilize unknown user relations from disrupted behaviors to speed up learning, and identify the corrupted users in an online setting. To robustly learn and utilize the unknown relations among potentially corrupted users, we propose a novel bandit algorithm RCLUB-WCU. To detect the corrupted users, we devise a novel online detection algorithm OCCUD based on RCLUB-WCU's inferred user relations. We prove a regret upper bound for RCLUB-WCU, which asymptotically matches the lower bound with respect to $T$ up to logarithmic factors, and matches the state-of-the-art results in degenerate cases. We also give a theoretical guarantee for the detection accuracy of OCCUD. With extensive experiments, our methods achieve superior performance over previous bandit algorithms and high corrupted user detection accuracy.

    * Authors: David Loiseaux, Mathieu Carrière, Andrew Blumberg
    * Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is an area of data science that focuses on using invariants from algebraic topology to provide multiscale shape descriptors for geometric data sets such as point clouds. One of the most important such descriptors is persistent homology, which encodes the change in shape as a filtration parameter changes; a typical parameter is the feature scale. For many data sets, it is useful to simultaneously vary multiple filtration parameters, for example feature scale and density. While the theoretical properties of single parameter persistent homology are well understood, less is known about the multiparameter case. A central question is the problem of representing multiparameter persistent homology by elements of a vector space for integration with standard machine learning algorithms. Existing approaches to this problem either ignore most of the multiparameter information to reduce to the one-parameter case or are heuristic and potentially unstable in the face of noise. In this article, we introduce a new general representation framework that leverages recent results on decompositions of multiparameter persistent homology. This framework is rich in information, fast to compute, and encompasses previous approaches. Moreover, we establish theoretical stability guarantees under this framework as well as efficient algorithms for practical computation, making this framework an applicable and versatile tool for analyzing geometric and point cloud data. We validate our stability results and algorithms with numerical experiments that demonstrate statistical convergence, prediction accuracy, and fast running times on several real data sets.

    * Abstract: Driven by the wide range of applications, scene text detection and recognition have become active research topics in computer vision. Though extensively studied, localizing and reading text in uncontrolled environments remain extremely challenging, due to various interference factors. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale representation for scene text recognition. This representation consists of a set of detectable primitives, termed as strokelets, which capture the essential substructures of characters at different granularities. Strokelets possess four distinctive advantages: (1) Usability: automatically learned from bounding box labels; (2) Robustness: insensitive to interference factors; (3) Generality: applicable to variant languages; and (4) Expressivity: effective at describing characters. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks verify the advantages of strokelets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for text recognition.

    * Abstract: Correlation clustering, or multicut partitioning, is widely used in image segmentation for partitioning an undirected graph or image with positive and negative edge weights such that the sum of cut edge weights is minimized. Due to its NP-hardness, exact solvers do not scale and approximative solvers often give unsatisfactory results. We investigate scalable methods for correlation clustering. To this end we define fusion moves for the correlation clustering problem. Our algorithm iteratively fuses the current and a proposed partitioning which monotonously improves the partitioning and maintains a valid partitioning at all times. Furthermore, it scales to larger datasets, gives near optimal solutions, and at the same time shows a good anytime performance.

    * Abstract: Topological data analysis offers a rich source of valuable information to study vision problems. Yet, so far we lack a theoretically sound connection to popular kernel-based learning techniques, such as kernel SVMs or kernel PCA. In this work, we establish such a connection by designing a multi-scale kernel for persistence diagrams, a stable summary representation of topological features in data. We show that this kernel is positive definite and prove its stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance. Experiments on two benchmark datasets for 3D shape classification/retrieval and texture recognition show considerable performance gains of the proposed method compared to an alternative approach that is based on the recently introduced persistence landscapes.

    * Abstract: Tracking multiple targets in a video, based on a finite set of detection hypotheses, is a persistent problem in computer vision. A common strategy for tracking is to first select hypotheses spatially and then to link these over time while maintaining disjoint path constraints. In crowded scenes multiple hypotheses will often be similar to each other making selection of optimal links an unnecessary hard optimization problem due to the sequential treatment of space and time. Embracing this observation, we propose to link and cluster plausible detections jointly across space and time. Specifically, we state multi-target tracking as a Minimum Cost Subgraph Multicut Problem. Evidence about pairs of detection hypotheses is incorporated whether the detections are in the same frame, neighboring frames or distant frames. This facilitates long-range re-identification and within-frame clustering. Results for published benchmark sequences demonstrate the superiority of this approach.

Therefore, scene text detection and recognition have become active research topics in computer vision. In this work, we investigate the problem of scene text detection from an alternative perspective and propose a novel algorithm for it. Different from traditional methods, which mainly make use of the properties of single characters or strokes, the proposed algorithm exploits the symmetry property of character groups and allows for direct extraction of text lines from natural images. The experiments on the latest ICDAR benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, compared to conventional approaches, the proposed algorithm shows stronger adaptability to texts in challenging scenarios.

We suggest using a Siamese CNN to independently, and in parallel, compute the descriptors of both images. The learned descriptors are then compared efficiently using the L2 norm and do not require network processing of patch pairs. The success of the method is based on an innovative loss function that computes higher moments of the loss distributions for each training batch. Combined with an Approximate Nearest Neighbor patch matching method and a flow interpolation technique, state of the art performance is obtained on the most challenging and competitive optical flow benchmarks.

    * Authors: Hao Jiang, Kristen Grauman
    * Abstract: Today's person detection methods work best when people are in common upright poses and appear reasonably well spaced out in the image. However, in many real images, that's not what people do. People often appear quite close to each other, e.g., with limbs linked or heads touching, and their poses are often not pedestrian-like. We propose an approach to detangle people in multi-person images. We formulate the task as a region assembly problem. Starting from a large set of overlapping regions from body part semantic segmentation and generic object proposals, our optimization approach reassembles those pieces together into multiple person instances. Since optimal region assembly is a challenging combinatorial problem, we present a Lagrangian relaxation method to accelerate the lower bound estimation, thereby enabling a fast branch and bound solution for the global optimum. As output, our method produces a pixel-level map indicating both 1) the body part labels (arm, leg, torso, and head), and 2) which parts belong to which individual person. Our results on challenging datasets show our method is robust to clutter, occlusion, and complex poses. It outperforms a variety of competing methods, including existing detector CRF methods and region CNN approaches. In addition, we demonstrate its impact on a proxemics recognition task, which demands a precise representation of "whose body part is where" in crowded images.

    * Abstract: This work addresses the task of instance-aware semantic segmentation. Our key motivation is to design a simple method with a new modelling-paradigm, which therefore has a different trade-off between advantages and disadvantages compared to known approaches. Our approach, we term InstanceCut, represents the problem by two output modalities: (i) an instance-agnostic semantic segmentation and (ii) all instance-boundaries. The former is computed from a standard convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation, and the latter is derived from a new instance-aware edge detection model. To reason globally about the optimal partitioning of an image into instances, we combine these two modalities into a novel MultiCut formulation. We evaluate our approach on the challenging CityScapes dataset. Despite the conceptual simplicity of our approach, we achieve the best result among all published methods, and perform particularly well for rare object classes.

    * Abstract: There have been remarkable improvements in the semantic labelling task in the recent years. However, the state of the art methods rely on large-scale pixel-level annotations. This paper studies the problem of training a pixel-wise semantic labeller network from image-level annotations of the present object classes. Recently, it has been shown that high quality seeds indicating discriminative object regions can be obtained from image-level labels. Without additional information, obtaining the full extent of the object is an inherently ill-posed problem due to co-occurrences. We propose using a saliency model as additional information and hereby exploit prior knowledge on the object extent and image statistics. We show how to combine both information sources in order to recover 80% of the fully supervised performance - which is the new state of the art in weakly supervised training for pixel-wise semantic labelling.

    * Abstract: We introduce a method to compute optical flow at multiple scales of motion, without resorting to multi- resolution or combinatorial methods. It addresses the key problem of small objects moving fast, and resolves the artificial binding between how large an object is and how fast it can move before being diffused away by clas- sical scale-space. Even with no learning, it achieves top performance on the most challenging optical flow benchmark. Moreover, the results are interpretable, and indeed we list the assumptions underlying our method explicitly. The key to our approach is the matching pro- gression from slow to fast, as well as the choice of in- terpolation method, or equivalently the prior, to fill in regions where the data allows it. We use several off- the-shelf components, with relatively low sensitivity to parameter tuning. Computational cost is comparable to the state-of-the-art.

    * Abstract: Safety is paramount for mobile robotic platforms such as self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles. This work is devoted to a task that is indispensable for safety yet was largely overlooked in the past -- detecting obstacles that are of very thin structures, such as wires, cables and tree branches. This is a challenging problem, as thin objects can be problematic for active sensors such as lidar and sonar and even for stereo cameras. In this work, we propose to use video sequences for thin obstacle detection. We represent obstacles with edges in the video frames, and reconstruct them in 3D using efficient edge-based visual odometry techniques. We provide both a monocular camera solution and a stereo camera solution. The former incorporates IMU data to solve scale ambiguity, while the latter enjoys a novel, purely vision-based solution. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed methods are fast and able to detect thin obstacles robustly and accurately under various conditions.

    * Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning on representing images for particular object retrieval, recent studies show that the learned representations still lie on manifolds in a high dimensional space. This makes the Euclidean nearest neighbor search biased for this task. Exploring the manifolds online remains expensive even if a nearest neighbor graph has been computed offline. This work introduces an explicit embedding reducing manifold search to Euclidean search followed by dot product similarity search. This is equivalent to linear graph filtering of a sparse signal in the frequency domain. To speed up online search, we compute an approximate Fourier basis of the graph offline. We improve the state of art on particular object retrieval datasets including the challenging Instre dataset containing small objects. At a scale of 10^5 images, the offline cost is only a few hours, while query time is comparable to standard similarity search.

    * Abstract: We present a method for automated analysis of human semen quality using microscopic video sequences of live semen samples. The videos are captured through an automated microscope at 400xmagnification. In each video frame, objects of interest are extracted using image processing techniques. A deep convolution neural network (CNN) is used to distinguish between sperms and non-sperm objects. The frame-wise count of sperm cells is used to estimate the concentration of sperms in unit volume of semen. In each video, individual sperm cells are tracked across the frames using a predictive approach which handles collisions and occlusions well. Based on their computed trajectories, sperms are classified into progressively motile, non-progressively motile and immotile types as per the WHO manual. In certain samples, due to various reasons, all visible objects drift in a certain direction, hence we also present a method for identifying and compensating for that drift. Experimental results are presented on a set of more than 100 semen samples collected from a clinical laboratory. The results compare well with existing accepted standard, SQA-V Gold for sperm concentration as well as motility parameters.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection has witnessed rapid progress especially with the recent development of convolutional neural networks. However, there still exists two challenges which prevent the algorithm into industry applications. On the one hand, most of the state-of-art algorithms require quadrangle bounding box which is in-accurate to locate the texts with arbitrary shape. On the other hand, two text instances which are close to each other may lead to a false detection which covers both instances. Traditionally, the segmentation-based approach can relieve the first problem but usually fail to solve the second challenge. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instances with arbitrary shapes. More specifically, PSENet generates the different scale of kernels for each text instance, and gradually expands the minimal scale kernel to the text instance with the complete shape. Due to the fact that there are large geometrical margins among the minimal scale kernels, our method is effective to split the close text instances, making it easier to use segmentation-based methods to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Extensive experiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate the effectiveness of PSENet. Notably, on CTW1500, a dataset full of long curve texts, PSENet achieves a F-measure of 74.3% at 27 FPS, and our best F-measure (82.2%) outperforms state-of-art algorithms by 6.6%. The code will be released in the future.

    * Abstract: 3D semantic segmentation is a fundamental building block for several scene understanding applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and AR/VR. Several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models suffer from the part-misclassification problem, wherein parts of the same object are labelled incorrectly. Previous methods have utilized hierarchical, iterative methods to fuse semantic and instance information, but they lack learnability in context fusion, and are computationally complex and heuristic driven. This paper presents Segment-Fusion, a novel attention-based method for hierarchical fusion of semantic and instance information to address the part misclassifications. The presented method includes a graph segmentation algorithm for grouping points into segments that pools point-wise features into segment-wise features, a learnable attention-based network to fuse these segments based on their semantic and instance features, and followed by a simple yet effective connected component labelling algorithm to convert segment features to instance labels. Segment-Fusion can be flexibly employed with any network architecture for semantic/instance segmentation. It improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of several semantic segmentation backbones by upto 5% on the ScanNet and S3DIS datasets.

    * Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised visual representation learning have paved the way for unsupervised methods tackling tasks such as object discovery and instance segmentation. However, discovering objects in an image with no supervision is a very hard task; what are the desired objects, when to separate them into parts, how many are there, and of what classes? The answers to these questions depend on the tasks and datasets of evaluation. In this work, we take a different approach and propose to look for the background instead. This way, the salient objects emerge as a by-product without any strong assumption on what an object should be. We propose FOUND, a simple model made of a single conv 1x1 initialized with coarse background masks extracted from self-supervised patch-based representations. After fast training and refining these seed masks, the model reaches state-of-the-art results on unsupervised saliency detection and object discovery benchmarks. Moreover, we show that our approach yields good results in the unsupervised semantic segmentation retrieval task. The code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/valeoai/FOUND.

    * Abstract: This paper proposes a cross-modal distillation framework PartDistill which transfers 2D knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) to facilitate 3D shape part segmentation. PartDistill addresses three major challenges in this task: the lack of 3D segmentation in invisible or undetected regions in the 2D projections inconsistent 2D predictions by VLMs and the lack of knowledge accumulation across different 3D shapes. PartDistill consists of a teacher network that uses a VLM to make 2D predictions and a student network that learns from the 2D predictions while extracting geometrical features from multiple 3D shapes to carry out 3D part segmentation. A bi-directional distillation including forward and backward distillations is carried out within the framework where the former forward distills the 2D predictions to the student network and the latter improves the quality of the 2D predictions which subsequently enhances the final 3D segmentation. Moreover PartDistill can exploit generative models that facilitate effortless 3D shape creation for generating knowledge sources to be distilled. Through extensive experiments PartDistill boosts the existing methods with substantial margins on widely used ShapeNetPart and PartNetE datasets by more than 15% and 12% higher mIoU scores respectively.

    * Abstract: Using multiple visual cameras to sensing traffic, especially tracking of vehicles, is a challenging task because of the large number of vehicle models, non-overlapping views, occlusion, view change and time-consuming algorithms. All of them remain obstacles in real world deployment. In this work, we propose a novel and flexible vehicle tracking framework, which formulates matching problem as a graph matching problem and solve it from the bottom up. In our framework, many restrictions can be added into the graph uniformly and simply. Moreover, we introduced an iterative Graph Matching Solver algorithm which can divide and reduce the graph matching problem's scale efficiently. Additionally, We also take the advantage of geographic information and make a combination with deep ReID features, motion and temporal information. The result shows that our algorithm achieves a 9th place at the AI City Challenge 2019.

    * Abstract: We make an attempt to address topology-awareness for 3D shape reconstruction. Two types of high-level shape typologies are being studied here, namely genus (number of cuttings/holes) and connectivity (number of connected components), which are of great importance in 3D object reconstruction/understanding but have been thus far disjoint from the existing dense voxel-wise prediction literature. We propose a topology-aware shape autoencoder component (TPWCoder) by approximating topology property functions such as genus and connectivity with neural networks from the latent variables. TPWCoder can be directly combined with the existing 3D shape reconstruction pipelines for end-to-end training and prediction. On the challenging A Big CAD Model Dataset (ABC), TPWCoder demonstrates a noticeable quantitative and qualitative improvement over the competing methods, and it also shows improved quantitative result on the ShapeNet dataset.

We demonstrate the utility of the proposed tracking algorithm on a wide variety of video sources while achieving state-of-the-art results on a boundary-accurate tracking dataset.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-scale topological feature representation for automatic analysis of hand posture. Such topological features have the advantage of being posture-dependent while being preserved under certain variations of illumination, rotation, personal dependency, etc. Our method studies the topology of the holes between the hand region and its convex hull. Inspired by the principle of Persistent Homology, which is the theory of computational topology for topological feature analysis over multiple scales, we construct the multi-scale Betti Numbers matrix (MSBNM) for the topological feature representation. In our experiments, we used 12 different hand postures and compared our features with three popular features (HOG, MCT, and Shape Context) on different data sets. In addition to hand postures, we also extend the feature representations to arm postures. The results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: We present a linear method for global camera pose registration from pairwise relative poses encoded in essential matrices. Our method minimizes an approximate geometric error to enforce the triangular relationship in camera triplets. This formulation does not suffer from the typical 'unbalanced scale' problem in linear methods relying on pairwise translation direction constraints, i.e. an algebraic error; nor the system degeneracy from collinear motion. In the case of three cameras, our method provides a good linear approximation of the trifocal tensor. It can be directly scaled up to register multiple cameras. The results obtained are accurate for point triangulation and can serve as a good initialization for final bundle adjustment. We evaluate the algorithm performance with different types of data and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our system produces good accuracy, robustness, and outperforms some well-known systems on efficiency.

    * Abstract: This paper proposes modeling the complex web image collections with an automatically generated graph structure called visual semantic complex network (VSCN). The nodes on this complex network are clusters of images with both visual and semantic consistency, called semantic concepts. These nodes are connected based on the visual and semantic correlations. Our VSCN with 33, 240 concepts is generated from a collection of Nwwmillion web images. iiA great deal of valuable information on the structures of the web image collections can be revealed by exploring the VSCN, such as the small-world behavior, concept community, indegree distribution, hubs, and isolated concepts. It not only helps us better understand the web image collections at a macroscopic level, but also has many important practical applications. This paper presents two application examples: content-based image retrieval and image browsing. Experimental results show that the VSCN leads to significant improvement on both the precision of image retrieval (over 200%) and user experience for image browsing.

    * Abstract: We address the problem of statistical learning of shape models which are invariant to translation, rotation and scale in compositional hierarchies when data spaces of measurements and shape spaces are not topological manifolds. In practice, this problem is observed while modeling shapes having multiple disconnected components, e.g. partially occluded shapes in cluttered scenes. We resolve the aforementioned problem by first reformulating the relationship between data and shape spaces considering the interaction between Receptive Fields (RFs) and Shape Manifolds (SMs) in a compositional hierarchical shape vocabulary. Then, we suggest a method to model the topological structure of the SMs for statistical learning of the geometric transformations of the shapes that are defined by group actions on the SMs. For this purpose, we design a disjoint union topology using an indexing mechanism for the formation of shape models on SMs in the vocabulary, recursively. We represent the topological relationship between shape components using graphs, which are aggregated to construct a hierarchical graph structure for the shape vocabulary. To this end, we introduce a framework to implement the indexing mechanisms for the employment of the vocabulary for structural shape classification. The proposed approach is used to construct invariant shape representations. Results on benchmark shape classification outperform state-of-the-art methods.

    * Authors: Mahyar Najibi,  Bharat Singh,  Larry S. Davis
    * Abstract: This paper describes AutoFocus, an efficient multi-scale inference algorithm for deep-learning based object detectors. Instead of processing an entire image pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels. The detector is only applied inside FocusChips, which reduces computation while processing finer scales. Different types of error can arise when detections from FocusChips of multiple scales are combined, hence techniques to correct them are proposed. AutoFocus obtains an mAP of 47.9% (68.3% at 50% overlap) on the COCO test-dev set while processing 6.4 images per second on a Titan X (Pascal) GPU. This is 2.5X faster than our multi-scale baseline detector and matches its mAP. The number of pixels processed in the pyramid can be reduced by 5X with a 1% drop in mAP. AutoFocus obtains more than 10% mAP gain compared to RetinaNet but runs at the same speed with the same ResNet-101 backbone.

    * Abstract: Understanding the visual world from the perspective of humans (egocentric) has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Egocentric videos exhibit high scene complexity and irregular motion flows compared to typical video understanding tasks. With the egocentric domain in mind, we address the problem of self-supervised, class-agnostic object detection, which aims to locate all objects in a given view, regardless of category, without any annotations or pre-training weights. Our method, self-supervised object Detection from Egocentric VIdeos (DEVI), generalizes appearance-based methods to learn features that are category-specific and invariant to viewing angles and illumination conditions from highly ambiguous environments in an end-to-end manner. Our approach leverages typical human behavior and its egocentric perception to sample diverse views of the same objects for our multi-view and scale-regression loss functions. With our learned cluster residual module, we are able to effectively describe multi-category patches for better complex scene understanding. DEVI provides a boost in performance on recent egocentric datasets, with performance gains up to 4.11% AP50, 0.11% AR1, 1.32% AR10, and 5.03% AR100, while significantly reducing model complexity. We also demonstrate competitive performance on out-of-domain datasets without additional training or fine-tuning.

    * Abstract: Daily objects commonly experience state changes. For example, slicing a cucumber changes its state from whole to sliced. Learning about object state changes in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is crucial for understanding and interacting with the visual world. Conventional VOS benchmarks do not consider this challenging yet crucial problem. This paper makes a pioneering effort to introduce a weakly-supervised benchmark on Video State-Changing Object Segmentation (VSCOS). We construct our VSCOS benchmark by selecting state-changing videos from existing datasets. In advocate of an annotation-efficient approach towards state-changing object segmentation, we only annotate the first and last frames of training videos, which is different from conventional VOS. Notably, an open-vocabulary setting is included to evaluate the generalization to novel types of objects or state changes. We empirically illustrate that state-of-the-art VOS models struggle with state-changing objects and lose track after the state changes. We analyze the main difficulties of our VSCOS task and identify three technical improvements, namely, fine-tuning strategies, representation learning, and integrating motion information. Applying these improvements results in a strong baseline for segmenting state-changing objects consistently. Our benchmark and baseline methods are publicly available at https://github.com/venom12138/VSCOS.

    * Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have revolutionized scene novel view synthesis, offering visually realistic, precise, and robust implicit reconstructions. While recent approaches enable NeRF editing, such as object removal, 3D shape modification, or material property manipulation, the manual annotation prior to such edits makes the process tedious. Additionally, traditional 2D interaction tools lack an accurate sense of 3D space, preventing precise manipulation and editing of scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called Blueprint Neural Field (BluNF), to address these editing issues. BluNF provides a robust and user-friendly 2D blueprint, enabling intuitive scene editing. By leveraging implicit neural representation, BluNF constructs a blueprint of a scene using prior semantic and depth information. The generated blueprint allows effortless editing and manipulation of NeRF representations. We demonstrate BluNF's editability through an intuitive click-and-change mechanism, enabling 3D manipulations, such as masking, appearance modification, and object removal. Our approach significantly contributes to visual content creation, paving the way for further research in this area.

    * Abstract: Free-form Human Robot Interaction (HRI) in naturalistic environments remains a challenging computer vision task. In this context, the extraction of human-body pose information is of utmost importance. Although the emergence of real-time depth cameras greatly facilitated this task, issues which limit the performance of existing methods in relevant HRI applications still exist. Applicability of current state-of-the art approaches is constrained by their inherent requirement of an initialization phase prior to deriving body pose information, which in complex, realistic scenarios, is often hard, if not impossible. In this work we present a data-driven model-based method for 3D torso pose estimation from RGB-D image sequences, eliminating the requirement of an initialization phase. The detected face of the user steers the initiation of shoulder areas hypotheses, based on illumination, scale and pose invariant features on the RGB silhouette. Depth point cloud information is subsequently utilized to approximate the shoulder joints and model the human torso based on a set of 3D geometric primitives and the estimation of the 3D torso pose is derived via a global optimization scheme. Experimental results in various environments, as well as using ground truth data and comparing to OpenNI User generator middleware results, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: As a rapidly growing medium, volumetric video is gaining attention beyond academia, reaching industry and creative communities alike. This brings new challenges to reduce the barrier to entry from a technical and economical point of view. We present a system for robustly and autonomously performing temporally coherent tracking for volumetric sequences, specifically targeting those from sparse setups or with noisy output. Our system will detect and recover missing pertinent geometry across highly incoherent sequences as well as provide users the option of propagating drastic topology edits. In this way, affordable multi-view setups can leverage temporal consistency to reduce processing and compression overheads while also generating more aesthetically pleasing volumetric sequences.

    * Abstract: We present a novel method for learning densities with bounded support which enables us to incorporate `hard' topological constraints. In particular, we show how emerging techniques from computational algebraic topology and the notion of Persistent Homology can be combined with kernel based methods from Machine Learning for the purpose of density estimation. The proposed formalism facilitates learning of models with bounded support in a principled way, and -- by incorporating Persistent Homology techniques in our approach -- we are able to encode algebraic-topological constraints which are not addressed in current state-of the art probabilistic models. We study the behaviour of our method on two synthetic examples for various sample sizes and exemplify the benefits of the proposed approach on a real-world data-set by learning a motion model for a racecar. We show how to learn a model which respects the underlying topological structure of the racetrack, constraining the trajectories of the car.

    * Abstract: Spectral graph partitioning methods have received significant attention from both practitioners and theorists in computer science. Some notable studies have been carried out regarding the behavior of these methods for infinitely large sample size (von Luxburg et al., 2008; Rohe et al., 2011), which provide sufficient confidence to practitioners about the effectiveness of these methods. On the other hand, recent developments in computer vision have led to a plethora of applications, where the model deals with multi-way affinity relations and can be posed as uniform hyper-graphs. In this paper, we view these models as random m-uniform hypergraphs and establish the consistency of spectral algorithm in this general setting. We develop a planted partition model or stochastic blockmodel for such problems using higher order tensors, present a spectral technique suited for the purpose and study its large sample behavior. The analysis reveals that the algorithm is consistent for m-uniform hypergraphs for larger values of m, and also the rate of convergence improves for increasing m. Our result provides the first theoretical evidence that establishes the importance of m-way affinities.

    * Abstract: This paper studies the following problem: given samples from a high dimensional discrete distribution, we want to estimate the leading $(\delta,\rho)$-modes of the underlying distributions. A point is defined to be a $(\delta,\rho)$-mode if it is a local optimum of the density within a $\delta$-neighborhood under metric $\rho$. As we increase the ``scale'' parameter $\delta$, the neighborhood size increases and the total number of modes monotonically decreases. The sequence of the $(\delta,\rho)$-modes reveal intrinsic topographical information of the underlying distributions. Though the mode finding problem is generally intractable in high dimensions, this paper unveils that, if the distribution can be approximated well by a tree graphical model, mode characterization is significantly easier. An efficient algorithm with provable theoretical guarantees is proposed and is applied to applications like data analysis and multiple predictions.

    * Abstract: Efforts to automate the reconstruction of neural circuits from 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images are critical for the field of connectomics. An important computation for reconstruction is the detection of neuronal boundaries. Images acquired by serial section EM, a leading 3D EM technique, are highly anisotropic, with inferior quality along the third dimension. For such images, the 2D max-pooling convolutional network has set the standard for performance at boundary detection. Here we achieve a substantial gain in accuracy through three innovations. Following the trend towards deeper networks for object recognition, we use a much deeper network than previously employed for boundary detection. Second, we incorporate 3D as well as 2D filters, to enable computations that use 3D context. Finally, we adopt a recursively trained architecture in which a first network generates a preliminary boundary map that is provided as input along with the original image to a second network that generates a final boundary map. Backpropagation training is accelerated by ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks that uses multicore CPU parallelism for speed. Our hybrid 2D-3D architecture could be more generally applicable to other types of anisotropic 3D images, including video, and our recursive framework for any image labeling problem.

    * Abstract: Given the apparent difficulty of learning models that are robust to adversarial perturbations, we propose tackling the simpler problem of developing adversarially robust features. Specifically, given a dataset and metric of interest, the goal is to return a function (or multiple functions) that 1) is robust to adversarial perturbations, and 2) has significant variation across the datapoints. We establish strong connections between adversarially robust features and a natural spectral property of the geometry of the dataset and metric of interest. This connection can be leveraged to provide both robust features, and a lower bound on the robustness of any function that has significant variance across the dataset. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the adversarially robust features given by this spectral approach can be fruitfully leveraged to learn a robust (and accurate) model.

    * Abstract: We study agents communicating over an underlying network by exchanging messages, in order to optimize their individual regret in a common nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problem. We derive regret minimization algorithms that guarantee for each agent $v$ an individual expected regret of $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\left(1+\frac{K}{\left|\mathcal{N}\left(v\right)\right|}\right)T}\right)$, where $T$ is the number of time steps, $K$ is the number of actions and $\mathcal{N}\left(v\right)$ is the set of neighbors of agent $v$ in the communication graph. We present algorithms both for the case that the communication graph is known to all the agents, and for the case that the graph is unknown. When the graph is unknown, each agent knows only the set of its neighbors and an upper bound on the total number of agents. The individual regret between the models differs only by a logarithmic factor. Our work resolves an open problem from [Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2019b].

    * Abstract: When training complex neural networks, memory usage can be an important bottleneck. The question of when to rematerialize, i.e., to recompute intermediate values rather than retaining them in memory, becomes critical to achieving the best time and space efficiency. In this work we consider the rematerialization problem and devise efficient algorithms that use structural characterizations of computation graphs---treewidth and pathwidth---to obtain provably efficient rematerialization schedules. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of these algorithms on many common deep learning models.

    * Abstract: Persistent homology has become an important tool for extracting geometric and topological features from data, whose multi-scale features are summarized in a persistence diagram. From a statistical perspective, however, persistence diagrams are very sensitive to perturbations in the input space. In this work, we develop a framework for constructing robust persistence diagrams from superlevel filtrations of robust density estimators constructed using reproducing kernels. Using an analogue of the influence function on the space of persistence diagrams, we establish the proposed framework to be less sensitive to outliers. The robust persistence diagrams are shown to be consistent estimators in the bottleneck distance, with the convergence rate controlled by the smoothness of the kernel — this, in turn, allows us to construct uniform confidence bands in the space of persistence diagrams. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to have security issues. One particular threat is the Trojan attack. It occurs when the attackers stealthily manipulate the model's behavior through Trojaned training samples, which can later be exploited. Guided by basic neuroscientific principles, we discover subtle -- yet critical -- structural deviation characterizing Trojaned models. In our analysis we use topological tools. They allow us to model high-order dependencies in the networks, robustly compare different networks, and localize structural abnormalities. One interesting observation is that Trojaned models develop short-cuts from shallow to deep layers. Inspired by these observations, we devise a strategy for robust detection of Trojaned models. Compared to standard baselines it displays better performance on multiple benchmarks.

    * Abstract: Transforming a causal system from a given initial state to a desired target state is an important task permeating multiple fields including control theory, biology, and materials science. In causal models, such transformations can be achieved by performing a set of interventions. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying a shift intervention that matches the desired mean of a system through active learning. We define the Markov equivalence class that is identifiable from shift interventions and propose two active learning strategies that are guaranteed to exactly match a desired mean. We then derive a worst-case lower bound for the number of interventions required and show that these strategies are optimal for certain classes of graphs. In particular, we show that our strategies may require exponentially fewer interventions than the previously considered approaches, which optimize for structure learning in the underlying causal graph. In line with our theoretical results, we also demonstrate experimentally that our proposed active learning strategies require fewer interventions compared to several baselines.

    * Abstract: The contextual linear bandit is an important online learning problem where given arm features, a learning agent selects an arm at each round to maximize the cumulative rewards in the long run. A line of works, called the clustering of bandits (CB), utilize the collaborative effect over user preferences and have shown significant improvements over classic linear bandit algorithms. However, existing CB algorithms require well-specified linear user models and can fail when this critical assumption does not hold. Whether robust CB algorithms can be designed for more practical scenarios with misspecified user models remains an open problem. In this paper, we are the first to present the important problem of clustering of bandits with misspecified user models (CBMUM), where the expected rewards in user models can be perturbed away from perfect linear models. We devise two robust CB algorithms, RCLUMB and RSCLUMB (representing the learned clustering structure with dynamic graph and sets, respectively), that can accommodate the inaccurate user preference estimations and erroneous clustering caused by model misspecifications. We prove regret upper bounds of $O(\epsilon_*T\sqrt{md\log T} + d\sqrt{mT}\log T)$ for our algorithms under milder assumptions than previous CB works, which match the lower bound asymptotically in $T$ up to logarithmic factors, and also match the state-of-the-art results in several degenerate cases. Our regret analysis is novel and different from the typical proof flow of previous CB works. The techniques in proving the regret caused by misclustering users are quite general and may be of independent interest. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show our outperformance over previous algorithms.

    * Abstract: Incorporating geometric inductive biases into models can aid interpretability and generalization, but encoding to a specific geometric structure can be challenging due to the imposed topological constraints. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically characterize obstructions to training encoders with geometric latent spaces. We show that local optima can arise due to singularities (e.g. self-intersection) or due to an incorrect degree or winding number. We then discuss how normalizing flows can potentially circumvent these obstructions by defining multimodal variational distributions. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new flow-based model that maps data points to multimodal distributions over geometric spaces and empirically evaluate our model on 2 domains. We observe improved stability during training and a higher chance of converging to a homeomorphic encoder.

Curvature constitutes one such property of graphs, and has recently started to prove useful in characterising graphs. Its expressive properties, stability, and practical utility in model evaluation remain largely unexplored, however. We combine graph curvature descriptors with emerging methods from topological data analysis to obtain robust, expressive descriptors for evaluating graph generative models.

    * Abstract: Graph neural networks, which typically exchange information between local neighbors, often struggle to capture long-range interactions (LRIs) within the graph. Building a graph hierarchy via graph pooling methods is a promising approach to address this challenge; however, hierarchical information propagation cannot entirely take over the role of local information aggregation. To balance locality and hierarchy, we integrate the local and hierarchical structures, represented by intra- and inter-graphs respectively, of a multi-scale graph hierarchy into a single mega graph. Our proposed MeGraph model consists of multiple layers alternating between local and hierarchical information aggregation on the mega graph. Each layer first performs local-aware message-passing on graphs of varied scales via the intra-graph edges, then fuses information across the entire hierarchy along the bidirectional pathways formed by inter-graph edges. By repeating this fusion process, local and hierarchical information could intertwine and complement each other. To evaluate our model, we establish a new Graph Theory Benchmark designed to assess LRI capture ability, in which MeGraph demonstrates dominant performance. Furthermore, MeGraph exhibits superior or equivalent performance to state-of-the-art models on the Long Range Graph Benchmark. The experimental results on commonly adopted real-world datasets further demonstrate the broad applicability of MeGraph.

We demonstrate the particular usefulness of these features for fine-grained visual categorization with new state-of-the-art results on bird species identification using the Caltech UCSD Birds (CUB) dataset and parity with the best existing results in face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Finally, we demonstrate the particular advantage of POOFs when training data is scarce.

    * Abstract: Repeated structures such as building facades, fences or road markings often represent a significant challenge for place recognition. Repeated structures are notoriously hard for establishing correspondences using multi-view geometry. Even more importantly, they violate the feature independence assumed in the bag-of-visual-words representation which often leads to over-counting evidence and significant degradation of retrieval performance. In this work we show that repeated structures are not a nuisance but, when appropriately represented, they form an important distinguishing feature for many places. We describe a representation of repeated structures suitable for scalable retrieval. It is based on robust detection of repeated image structures and a simple modification of weights in the bag-of-visual-word model. Place recognition results are shown on datasets of street-level imagery from Pittsburgh and San Francisco demonstrating significant gains in recognition performance compared to the standard bag-of-visual-words baseline and more recently proposed burstiness weighting.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to tracking people in crowded scenes, where people are subject to long-term (partial) occlusions and may assume varying postures and articulations. In such videos, detection-based trackers give poor performance since detecting people occurrences is not reliable, and common assumptions about locally smooth trajectories do not hold. Rather, we use temporal mid-level features (e.g., supervoxels or dense point trajectories) as a more coherent spatiotemporal basis for handling occlusion and pose variations.Thus, we formulate tracking as labeling mid-level features by object identifiers, and specify a new approach, called constrained sequential labeling (CSL), for performing this labeling. CSL uses a cost function to sequentially assign labels while respecting the implications of hard constraints computed via constraint propagation. A key feature of this approach is that it allows for the use of flexible cost functions and constraints that capture complex dependencies that cannot be represented in standard network-flow formulations. To exploit this flexibility we describe how to learn constraints and give a provably correct learning algorithms for cost functions that achieves finitetime convergence at a rate that improves with the strength of the constraints. Our experimental results indicate that CSL outperforms the state-of-the-art on challenging real-world videos of volleyball, basketball, and pedestrians walking.

We design the algorithm to count holes that are most persistent in the filtration of offsets (neighborhoods) around given points. The input is a cloud of n points in the plane without any user-defined parameters. The algorithm has a near linear time and a linear space O(n). The output is the array (number of holes, relative persistence in the filtration). We prove theoretical guarantees when the algorithm finds the correct number of holes (components in the complement) of an unknown shape approximated by a cloud.

    * Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of assigning object class labels to image pixels. Following recent holistic formulations, we cast scene labeling as inference of a conditional random field (CRF) grounded onto superpixels. The CRF inference is specified as quadratic program (QP) with mutual exclusion (mutex) constraints on class label assignments. The QP is solved using a beam search (BS), which is well-suited for scene labeling, because it explicitly accounts for spatial extents of objects; conforms to inconsistency constraints from domain knowledge; and has low computational costs. BS gradually builds a search tree whose nodes correspond to candidate scene labelings. Successor nodes are repeatedly generated from a select set of their parent nodes until convergence. We prove that our BS efficiently maximizes the QP objective of CRF inference. Effectiveness of our BS for scene labeling is evaluated on the benchmark MSRC, Stanford Backgroud, PASCAL VOC 2009 and 2010 datasets.

    * Abstract: The analysis of deformable 3D shape is often cast in terms of the shape's intrinsic geometry due to its invariance to a wide range of non-rigid deformations. However, object's plasticity in non-rigid transformation often results in transformations that are not completely isometric in the surface's geometry and whose mode of deviation from isometry is an identifiable characteristic of the shape and its deformation modes. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model of the variations of the intrinsic metric of deformable shapes, based on the spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. To this end, we assume two independent models for the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the graph-Laplacian of a 3d mesh which are learned in a supervised way from a set of shapes belonging to the same class. We show how this model can be efficiently learned given a set of 3D meshes, and evaluate the performance of the resulting generative model in shape classification and retrieval tasks. Comparison with state-of-the-art solutions for these problems confirm the validity of the approach.

    * Abstract: Face recognition has the perception of a solved problem, however when tested at the million-scale exhibits dramatic variation in accuracies across the different algorithms [??]. Are the algorithms very different? Is access to good/big training data their secret weapon? Where should face recognition improve? To address those questions, we created a benchmark, MF2, that requires all algorithms to be trained on same data, and tested at the million scale. MF2 is a public large-scale set with 672K identities and 4.7M photos created with the goal to level playing field for large scale face recognition. We contrast our results with findings from the other two large-scale benchmarks MegaFace Challenge and MS-Celebs-1M where groups were allowed to train on any private/public/big/small set. Some key discoveries: 1) algorithms, trained on MF2, were able to achieve state of the art and comparable results to algorithms trained on massive private sets, 2) some outperformed themselves once trained on MF2, 3) invariance to aging suffers from low accuracies as in MegaFace, identifying the need for larger age variations possibly within identities or adjustment of algorithms in future testing.

    * Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning image semantic segmentation networks only using image-level labels as supervision, which is important since it can significantly reduce human annotation efforts. Recent state-of-the-art methods on this problem first infer the sparse and discriminative regions for each object class using a deep classification network, then train semantic a segmentation network using the discriminative regions as supervision. Inspired by the traditional image segmentation methods of seeded region growing, we propose to train a semantic segmentation network starting from the discriminative regions and progressively increase the pixel-level supervision using by seeded region growing. The seeded region growing module is integrated in a deep segmentation network and can benefit from deep features. Different from conventional deep networks which have fixed/static labels, the proposed weakly-supervised network generates new labels using the contextual information within an image. The proposed method significantly outperforms the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods using static labels, and obtains the state-of-the-art performance, which are 63.2% mIoU score on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set and 26.0% mIoU score on the COCO dataset.

    * Abstract: We present a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images. Given a novel semantic layout at test time, the memory bank is used to retrieve photographic references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material. Experiments on multiple semantic segmentation datasets show that the presented approach yields considerably more realistic images than recent purely parametric techniques.

    * Abstract: We propose a new supervized learning framework for oversegmenting 3D point clouds into superpoints. We cast this problem as learning deep embeddings of the local geometry and radiometry of 3D points, such that the border of objects presents high contrasts. The embeddings are computed using a lightweight neural network operating on the points' local neighborhood. Finally, we formulate point cloud oversegmentation as a graph partition problem with respect to the learned embeddings. This new approach allows us to set a new state-of-the-art in point cloud oversegmentation by a significant margin, on a dense indoor dataset (S3DIS) and a sparse outdoor one (vKITTI). Our best solution requires over five times fewer superpoints to reach similar performance than previously published methods on S3DIS. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be used to improve superpoint-based semantic segmentation algorithms, setting a new state-of-the-art for this task as well.

    * Abstract: Recognising actions in videos relies on labelled supervision during training, typically the start and end times of each action instance. This supervision is not only subjective, but also expensive to acquire. Weak video-level supervision has been successfully exploited for recognition in untrimmed videos, however it is challenged when the number of different actions in training videos increases. We propose a method that is supervised by single timestamps located around each action instance, in untrimmed videos. We replace expensive action bounds with sampling distributions initialised from these timestamps. We then use the classifier's response to iteratively update the sampling distributions. We demonstrate that these distributions converge to the location and extent of discriminative action segments. We evaluate our method on three datasets for fine-grained recognition, with increasing number of different actions per video, and show that single timestamps offer a reasonable compromise between recognition performance and labelling effort, performing comparably to full temporal supervision. Our update method improves top-1 test accuracy by up to 5.4%. across the evaluated datasets.

    * Abstract: Panoptic segmentation aims to partition an image to object instances and semantic content for thing and stuff categories, respectively. To date, learning weakly supervised panoptic segmentation (WSPS) with only image-level labels remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose an efficient jointly thing-and-stuff mining (JTSM) framework for WSPS. To this end, we design a novel mask of interest pooling (MoIPool) to extract fixed-size pixel-accurate feature maps of arbitrary-shape segmentations. MoIPool enables a panoptic mining branch to leverage multiple instance learning (MIL) to recognize things and stuff segmentation in a unified manner. We further refine segmentation masks with parallel instance and semantic segmentation branches via self-training, which collaborates the mined masks from panoptic mining with bottom-up object evidence as pseudo-ground-truth labels to improve spatial coherence and contour localization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of JTSM on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. As a by-product, we achieve competitive results for weakly supervised object detection and instance segmentation. This work is a first step towards tackling challenge panoptic segmentation task with only image-level labels.

    * Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is crucial both for visualization and preprocessing high dimensional data for machine learning. We introduce a novel method based on a hierarchy built on 1-nearest neighbor graphs in the original space which is used to preserve the grouping properties of the data distribution on multiple levels. The core of the proposal is an optimization-free projection that is competitive with the latest versions of t-SNE and UMAP in performance and visualization quality while being an order of magnitude faster at run-time. Furthermore, its interpretable mechanics, the ability to project new data, and the natural separation of data clusters in visualizations make it a general purpose unsupervised dimension reduction technique. In the paper, we argue about the soundness of the proposed method and evaluate it on a diverse collection of datasets with sizes varying from 1K to 11M samples and dimensions from 28 to 16K. We perform comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on multiple metrics and target dimensions highlighting its efficiency and performance.

Our key idea to to learn a local parameterization in a data-driven manner, using a novel differentiable parameterization layer within a neural network framework. We train a segmentation network to select 3D regions that are parameterized into 2D and penalized by the resulting distortion, giving rise to segmentations which are distortion-aware. Following training, a user can use our system to interactively select a point on the mesh and obtain a large, meaningful region around the selection which induces a low-distortion parameterization.

    * Abstract: This paper considers methods for extracting blood volume pulse (BVP) representations from video of the human face. Whereas most previous systems have been concerned with estimating vital signs such as average heart rate, this paper addresses the more difficult problem of recovering BVP signal morphology. We present a new approach that is inspired by temporal encoder-decoder architectures that have been used for audio signal separation. As input, this system accepts a temporal sequence of RGB (red, green, blue) values that have been spatially averaged over a small portion of the face. The output of the system is a temporal sequence that approximates a BVP signal. In order to reduce noise in the recovered signal, a separate processing step extracts individual pulses and performs normalization and outlier removal. After these steps, individual pulse shapes have been extracted that are sufficiently distinct to support biometric authentication. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extracting BVP signal morphology from facial videos, which presents exciting opportunities for further research in this area.

    * Authors: Andac Demir, Elie Massaad, Bulent Kiziltan
    * Abstract: The efficacy of segmentation algorithms is frequently compromised by topological errors like overlapping regions, disrupted connections, and voids. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel loss function, namely Topology-Aware Focal Loss (TAFL), that incorporates the conventional Focal Loss with a topological constraint term based on the Wasserstein distance between the ground truth and predicted segmentation masks' persistence diagrams. By enforcing identical topology as the ground truth, the topological constraint can effectively resolve topological errors, while Focal Loss tackles class imbalance. We begin by constructing persistence diagrams from filtered cubical complexes of the ground truth and predicted segmentation masks. We subsequently utilize the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to determine the optimal transport plan between the two persistence diagrams. The resultant transport plan minimizes the cost of transporting mass from one distribution to the other and provides a mapping between the points in the two persistence diagrams. We then compute the Wasserstein distance based on this travel plan to measure the topological dissimilarity between the ground truth and predicted masks. We evaluate our approach by training a 3D U-Net with the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge validation dataset, which requires accurate segmentation of 3D MRI scans that integrate various modalities for the precise identification and tracking of malignant brain tumors. Then, we demonstrate that the quality of segmentation performance is enhanced by regularizing the focal loss through the addition of a topological constraint as a penalty term.

    * Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) deals with training a model on a labeled source domain with the aim of generalizing to unseen domains during inference. Existing DGSS methods typically effectuate robust features by means of Domain Randomization (DR). Such an approach is often limited as it can only account for style diversification and not content. In this work we take an orthogonal approach to DGSS and propose to use an assembly of CoLlaborative FOUndation models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (CLOUDS). In detail CLOUDS is a framework that integrates Foundation Models of various kinds: (i) CLIP backbone for its robust feature representation (ii) Diffusion Model to diversify the content thereby covering various modes of the possible target distribution and (iii) Segment Anything Model (SAM) for iteratively refining the predictions of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our CLOUDS excels in adapting from synthetic to real DGSS benchmarks and under varying weather conditions notably outperforming prior methods by 5.6% and 6.7% on averaged mIoU respectively.

    * Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been a potent technique to handle the lack of annotations in the target domain particularly in semantic segmentation task. This study introduces a different UDA scenarios where the target domain contains unlabeled video frames. Drawing upon recent advancements of self-supervised learning of the object motion from unlabeled videos with geometric constraint we design a Motion-guided Domain Adaptive semantic segmentation framework (MoDA). MoDA harnesses the self-supervised object motion cues to facilitate cross-domain alignment for segmentation task. First we present an object discovery module to localize and segment target moving objects using object motion information. Then we propose a semantic mining module that takes the object masks to refine the pseudo labels in the target domain. Subsequently these high-quality pseudo labels are used in the self-training loop to bridge the cross-domain gap. On domain adaptive video and image segmentation experiments MoDA shows the effectiveness utilizing object motion as guidance for domain alignment compared with optical flow information. Moreover MoDA exhibits versatility as it can complement existing state-of-the-art UDA approaches.

A smart lighting system that provides automatic control of lighting illumination and color temperature needs to track human motion and understand human activities. Infrared and thermal spectrum provides useful information robust to the lighting condition. Depth information can be acquired independently of the lighting condition and it is relatively easy to detect humans independent of their clothing, and skin color. Commercial depth cameras or thermal cameras were used for accurate tracking and for estimating human behavior. The activity modes can be estimated using the human motion tracking results from depth cameras and from thermal cameras. Multiple depth cameras were used to detect human subject motion in a large area. The activity modes such as study mode and watching TV mode were estimated and the illumination and color temperature of the LED lighting system were controlled in real time according to the estimated activity.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we present techniques for automated understanding of tutor-student behavior through detecting visual deictic gestures, in the context of one-to-one mathematics tutoring. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work in the area of intelligent tutoring systems, which focuses on spatial localization of deictic gestural activity, i.e. where the deictic gesture is pointing on the workspace. A new dataset called SDMATH is first introduced. The motivation for detecting deictic gestures and their spatial properties is established, followed by techniques for automatic localization of deictic gestures in a workspace. The techniques employ computer vision and machine learning steps such as GBVS saliency, binary morphology and HOG-SVM classification. It is shown that the method localizes the deictic tip with an accuracy of over 85% accuracy for a cut off distance of 12 pixels. Furthermore, a detailed discussion using examples from the proposed dataset is presented on high-level inferences about the student-tutor interactions that can be derived from the integration of spatial and temporal localization of the deictic gestural activity using the proposed techniques.

We propose a new framework for the unsupervised simultaneous detection of natural image of lines and camera parameters estimation, enabling a robust calibration from a single image. Comparative experiments with existing automatic approaches for the distortion estimation and with ground truth data are presented.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel and an efficient method for reconstructing the 3D arrangement of lines extracted from a single image, using vanishing points, orthogonal structure, and an optimization procedure that considers all plausible connectivity constraints between lines. Line detection identifies a large number of salient lines that intersect or nearly intersect in an image, but relatively a few of these apparent junctions correspond to real intersections in the 3D scene. We use linear programming (LP) to identify a minimal set of least-violated connectivity constraints that are sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct the 3D lines. In contrast to prior solutions that primarily focused on well-behaved synthetic line drawings with severely restricting assumptions, we develop an algorithm that can work on real images. The algorithm produces line reconstruction by identifying 95% correct connectivity constraints in York Urban database, with a total computation time of 1 second per image.

    * Authors: William Nguatem, Helmut Mayer
    * Abstract: We present a method for Modeling Urban Scenes from Pointclouds (MUSP). In contrast to existing approaches, MUSP is robust, scalable and provides a more complete description by not making a Manhattan-World assumption and modeling both buildings (with polyhedra) as well as the non-planar ground (using NURBS). First, we segment the scene into consistent patches using a divide-and-conquer based algorithm within a nonparametric Bayesian framework (stick-breaking construction). These patches often correspond to meaningful structures, such as the ground, facades, roofs and roof superstructures. We use polygon sweeping to fit predefined templates for buildings, and for the ground, a NURBS surface is fit and uniformly tessellated. Finally, we apply boolean operations to the polygons for buildings, buildings parts and the tesselated ground to clip unnecessary geometry (e.g., facades protrusions below the non-planar ground), leading to the final model. The explicit Bayesian formulation of scene segmentation makes our approach suitable for challenging datasets with varying amounts of noise, outliers, and point density. We demonstrate the robustness of MUSP on 3D pointclouds from image matching as well as LiDAR.

    * Authors: Miaojing Shi, Holger Caesar, Vittorio Ferrari
    * Abstract: We propose to help weakly supervised object localization for classes where location annotations are not available, by transferring things and stuff knowledge from a source set with available annotations. The source and target classes might share similar appearance (e.g. bear fur is similar to cat fur) or appear against similar background (e.g. horse and sheep appear against grass). To exploit this, we acquire three types of knowledge from the source set: a segmentation model trained on both thing and stuff classes; similarity relations between target and source classes; and co-occurrence relations between thing and stuff classes in the source. The segmentation model is used to generate thing and stuff segmentation maps on a target image, while the class similarity and co-occurrence knowledge help refining them. We then incorporate these maps as new cues into a multiple instance learning framework (MIL), propagating the transferred knowledge from the pixel level to the object proposal level. In extensive experiments, we conduct our transfer from the PASCAL Context dataset (source) to the ILSVRC, COCO and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets (targets). We evaluate our transfer across widely different thing classes, including some that are not similar in appearance, but appear against similar background. The results demonstrate significant improvement over standard MIL, and we outperform the state-of-the-art in the transfer setting.

    * Authors: Boran Han, Jeremy Vila
    * Abstract: Parametric curve tracing enables wide applications, such as lane following in autonomous driving, volumetric reconstruction in seismic, single-molecule/protein tracking in microscopy. Most existing parametric curve tracing methods require several steps, including curve identification and parameterization. Such multi-step methods can lead to lengthy and complicated parameter optimization. Additionally, the performance of curve identification methods can be degraded by noisy or low-light images. To address these challenges, we present a novel single-step approach to trace curves parametrically via optimizing a self-defined non-linear objective function that describes several key properties of the curve. Under the assumption that signals along the curve resemble each other, our objective function will guide this pathfinding process from a seed point along the direction according to maximum cosine similarity. No pre- and post-processing step is required to measure the tangent or normal vectors. We visualize our objective function and conduct several numerical experiments. These empirical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other competing methods across image domains. It yields better accuracy even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

    * Abstract: Segmentation of point clouds is a necessary pre-processing technique when object discrimination is needed for scene understanding. In this paper, we propose a segmentation technique utilizing 2D bounding-box data obtained via the orthographic projection of 3D points onto a plane at multiple elevation layers. Connected components is utilized to obtain bounding-box data, and a consistency metric between bounding-boxes at various elevation layers helps determine the classification of the bounding-box to an object of the scene. The merging of point data within each 2D bounding-box results in an object-segmented point cloud. Our method conducts segmentation using only the topological information of the point data within a dataset, requiring no extra computation of normals, creation of an octree or k-d tree, nor a dependency on RGB or intensity data associated with a point. Initial experiments are run on a set of point cloud datasets obtained via photogrammetric means, as well as some open-source, LIDAR-generated point clouds, showing the method to be capture agnostic. Results demonstrate the efficacy of this method in obtaining a distinct set of objects contained within a point cloud.

    * Abstract: Human readers or radiologists routinely perform full-body multi-organ multi-disease detection and diagnosis in clinical practice, while most medical AI systems are built to focus on single organs with a narrow list of a few diseases. This might severely limit AI's clinical adoption. A certain number of AI models need to be assembled non-trivially to match the diagnostic process of a human reading a CT scan. In this paper, we construct a Unified Tumor Transformer (CancerUniT) model to jointly detect tumor existence & location and diagnose tumor characteristics for eight major cancers in CT scans. CancerUniT is a query-based Mask Transformer model with the output of multi-tumor prediction. We decouple the object queries into organ queries, tumor detection queries and tumor diagnosis queries, and further establish hierarchical relationships among the three groups. This clinically-inspired architecture effectively assists inter- and intra-organ representation learning of tumors and facilitates the resolution of these complex, anatomically related multi-organ cancer image reading tasks. CancerUniT is trained end-to-end using curated large-scale CT images of 10,042 patients including eight major types of cancers and occurring non-cancer tumors (all are pathology-confirmed with 3D tumor masks annotated by radiologists). On the test set of 631 patients, CancerUniT has demonstrated strong performance under a set of clinically relevant evaluation metrics, substantially outperforming both multi-disease methods and an assembly of eight single-organ expert models in tumor detection, segmentation, and diagnosis. This moves one step closer towards a universal high performance cancer screening tool.

    * Abstract: Nuclear instance segmentation has been critical for pathology image analysis in medical science, e.g., cancer diagnosis. Current methods typically adopt pixel-wise optimization for nuclei boundary exploration, where rich structural information could be lost for subsequent quantitative morphology assessment. To address this issue, we develop a topology-aware segmentation approach, termed TopoSeg, which exploits topological structure information to keep the predictions rational, especially in common situations with densely touching and overlapping nucleus instances. Concretely, TopoSeg builds on a topology-aware module (TAM), which encodes dynamic changes of different topology structures within the three-class probability maps (inside, boundary, and background) of the nuclei to persistence barcodes and makes the topology-aware loss function. To efficiently focus on regions with high topological errors, we propose an adaptive topology-aware selection (ATS) strategy to enhance the topology-aware optimization procedure further. Experiments on three nuclear instance segmentation datasets justify the superiority of TopoSeg, which achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/hhlisme/toposeg.

Using our efficient model in a data collection loop, we built the largest segmentation dataset to date (by far), with over 1 billion masks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive -- often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at https://segment-anything.com to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.

    * Abstract: Detecting symmetrical properties is a fundamental task in 3D shape analysis. In the case of a 3D model with planar symmetries, each point has a corresponding mirror point w.r.t. a symmetry plane, and the correspondences remain invariant under any arbitrary Euclidean transformation. Our proposed method, E3Sym, aims to detect planar reflective symmetry in an unsupervised and end-to-end manner by leveraging E(3) invariance. E3Sym establishes robust point correspondences through the use of E(3) invariant features extracted from a lightweight neural network, from which the dense symmetry prediction is produced. We also introduce a novel and efficient clustering algorithm to aggregate the dense prediction and produce a detected symmetry set, allowing for the detection of an arbitrary number of planar symmetries while ensuring the method remains differentiable for end-to-end training. Our method also possesses the ability to infer reasonable planar symmetries from incomplete shapes, which remains challenging for existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that E3Sym is both effective and robust, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

For the same reason, the necessary effort to annotate training data is tremendous, motivating approaches to minimize human involvement. Our labeling tool iteratively verifies or modifies part labels predicted by a deep neural network, with human feedback continually improving the network prediction. To effectively reduce human efforts, we develop two novel features in our tool, hierarchical and symmetry-aware active labeling. Our human-in-the-loop approach, coined HAL3D, achieves close to error-free fine-grained annotations on any test set with pre-defined hierarchical part labels, with 80% time-saving over manual effort. We will release the finely labeled models to serve the community.

    * Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Data annotation for training supervised methods can be labor-intensive, motivating unsupervised methods. Current approaches often rely on extracting deep features from pre-trained networks to construct a graph, and classical clustering methods like k-means and normalized-cuts are then applied as a post-processing step. However, this approach reduces the high-dimensional information encoded in the features to pair-wise scalar affinities. To address this limitation, this study introduces a lightweight Graph Neural Network (GNN) to replace classical clustering methods while optimizing for the same clustering objective function. Unlike existing methods, our GNN takes both the pair-wise affinities between local image features and the raw features as input. This direct connection between the raw features and the clustering objective enables us to implicitly perform classification of the clusters between different graphs, resulting in part semantic segmentation without the need for additional post-processing steps. We demonstrate how classical clustering objectives can be formulated as self-supervised loss functions for training an image segmentation GNN. Furthermore, we employ the Correlation-Clustering (CC) objective to perform clustering without defining the number of clusters, allowing for k-less clustering. We apply the proposed method for object localization, segmentation, and semantic part segmentation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

    * Abstract: Line art is arguably one of the fundamental and versatile modes of expression. We propose a pipeline for a robot to look at a grayscale line art and redraw it. The key novel elements of our pipeline are: a) we propose a novel task of mimicking line drawings, b) to solve the pipeline we modify the Quick-draw dataset and obtain supervised training for converting a line drawing into a series of strokes c) we propose a multi-stage segmentation and graph interpretation pipeline for solving the problem. The resultant method has also been deployed on a CNC plotter as well as a robotic arm. We have trained several variations of the proposed methods and evaluate these on a dataset obtained from Quick-draw. Through the best methods we observe an accuracy of around 98% for this task, which is a significant improvement over the baseline architecture we adapted from. This therefore allows for deployment of the method on robots for replicating line art in a reliable manner. We also show that while the rule-based vectorization methods do suffice for simple drawings, it fails for more complicated sketches, unlike our method which generalizes well to more complicated distributions.

    * Abstract: Subsea hydrothermal vents, typically existing at water depths below natural light penetration, contain diverse and unique macrofaunal environments. Traditionally, long-term ecological observation has been difficult as the extreme depth, temperature and pressure make in situ video surveys challenging. However, the introduction of subsea cabled arrays has allowed for the long time series collection of high definition imagery from these vents. To study the benthic hydrothermal vent environment, we propose an inference pipeline consisting of a U-Net followed by VGG-16 CNN to perform instance segmentation of scale worms, a specific macrofaunal family. The developed pipeline exhibits an average precision (AP) of 0.671 AP@[0.5], despite the difficult camouflaged imagery and low training data inputs. We further explore full pipeline training data requirements, as the dynamic scene in question requires the pipeline to be re-trained on an approximately monthly basis for effective segmentation. We find that the VGG-16 CNN portion of the pipeline is typically more sensitive to training data variation than the U-Net portion.

    * Abstract: We propose a straightforward yet highly effective few-shot fine-tuning strategy for adapting the Segment Anything (SAM) to anatomical segmentation tasks in medical images. Our novel approach revolves around reformulating the mask decoder within SAM, leveraging few-shot embeddings derived from a limited set of labeled images (few-shot collection) as prompts for querying anatomical objects captured in image embeddings. This innovative reformulation greatly reduces the need for time-consuming online user interactions for labeling volumetric images, such as exhaustively marking points and bounding boxes to provide prompts slice by slice. With our method, users can manually segment a few 2D slices offline, and the embeddings of these annotated image regions serve as effective prompts for online segmentation tasks. Our method prioritizes the efficiency of the fine-tuning process by exclusively training the mask decoder through caching mechanisms while keeping the image encoder frozen. Importantly, this approach is not limited to volumetric medical images, but can generically be applied to any 2D/3D segmentation task. To thoroughly evaluate our method, we conducted extensive validation on four datasets, covering six anatomical segmentation tasks across two modalities. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of different prompting options within SAM and the fully-supervised nnU-Net. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to SAM employing only point prompts (50% improvement in IoU) and performs on-par with fully supervised methods whilst reducing the requirement of labeled data by at least an order of magnitude.

    * Publisher: NeurIPS
    * Publication Date: `2012`
    * Authors: Antonino Freno, Mikaela Keller, Marc Tommasi
    * Abstract: Statistical models for networks have been typically committed to strong prior assumptions concerning the form of the modeled distributions. Moreover, the vast majority of currently available models are explicitly designed for capturing some specific graph properties (such as power-law degree distributions), which makes them unsuitable for application to domains where the behavior of the target quantities is not known a priori. The key contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the Fiedler delta statistic, based on the Laplacian spectrum of graphs, which allows to dispense with any parametric assumption concerning the modeled network properties. Second, we use the defined statistic to develop the Fiedler random field model, which allows for efficient estimation of edge distributions over large-scale random networks. After analyzing the dependence structure involved in Fiedler random fields, we estimate them over several real-world networks, showing that they achieve a much higher modeling accuracy than other well-known statistical approaches.

    * Abstract: We consider the canonical problem of influence maximization in social networks. Since the seminal work of Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos there have been two, largely disjoint efforts on this problem. The first studies the problem associated with learning the generative model that produces cascades, and the second focuses on the algorithmic challenge of identifying a set of influencers, assuming the generative model is known. Recent results on learning and optimization imply that in general, if the generative model is not known but rather learned from training data, no algorithm for influence maximization can yield a constant factor approximation guarantee using polynomially-many samples, drawn from any distribution. In this paper we describe a simple algorithm for maximizing influence from training data. The main idea behind the algorithm is to leverage the strong community structure of social networks and identify a set of individuals who are influentials but whose communities have little overlap. Although in general, the approximation guarantee of such an algorithm is unbounded, we show that this algorithm performs well experimentally. To analyze its performance, we prove this algorithm obtains a constant factor approximation guarantee on graphs generated through the stochastic block model, traditionally used to model networks with community structure.

    * Abstract: We present MubyNet -- a feed-forward, multitask, bottom up system for the integrated localization, as well as 3d pose and shape estimation, of multiple people in monocular images. The challenge is the formal modeling of the problem that intrinsically requires discrete and continuous computation, e.g. grouping people vs. predicting 3d pose. The model identifies human body structures (joints and limbs) in images, groups them based on 2d and 3d information fused using learned scoring functions, and optimally aggregates such responses into partial or complete 3d human skeleton hypotheses under kinematic tree constraints, but without knowing in advance the number of people in the scene and their visibility relations. We design a multi-task deep neural network with differentiable stages where the person grouping problem is formulated as an integer program based on learned body part scores parameterized by both 2d and 3d information. This avoids suboptimality resulting from separate 2d and 3d reasoning, with grouping performed based on the combined representation. The final stage of 3d pose and shape prediction is based on a learned attention process where information from different human body parts is optimally integrated. State-of-the-art results are obtained in large scale datasets like Human3.6M and Panoptic, and qualitatively by reconstructing the 3d shape and pose of multiple people, under occlusion, in difficult monocular images.

    * Abstract: Ranking and selection tasks appear in different contexts with specific desiderata, such as the maximizaton of average relevance on the top of the list, the requirement of diverse rankings, or, relatedly, the focus on providing at least one relevant items to as many users as possible. This paper addresses the question of which of these tasks are asymptotically solved by sorting by decreasing order of expected utility, for some suitable notion of utility, or, equivalently, \emph{when is square loss regression consistent for ranking \emph{via} score-and-sort?}. We provide an answer to this question in the form of a structural characterization of ranking losses for which a suitable regression is consistent. This result has two fundamental corollaries. First, whenever there exists a consistent approach based on convex risk minimization, there also is a consistent approach based on regression. Second, when regression is not consistent, there are data distributions for which consistent surrogate approaches necessarily have non-trivial local minima, and optimal scoring function are necessarily discontinuous, even when the underlying data distribution is regular. In addition to providing a better understanding of surrogate approaches for ranking, these results illustrate the intrinsic difficulty of solving general ranking problems with the score-and-sort approach.

    * Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology for gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed from fMRI measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over time. However, analysing such data presents a challenge due to the large degree of noise and person-to-person variation in how information is represented in the brain. To address this challenge, we present a novel topological approach that encodes each time point in an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological features, i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust towards noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be clustered to find meaningful groupings between participants, and that they are also useful in studying within-subject brain state trajectories of subjects performing a particular task. Here, we apply both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to a group of participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. We observe significant differences in both brain state trajectories and overall topological activity between adults and children watching the same movie.

    * Authors: Tahrima Rahman, Sara Rouhani, Vibhav Gogate
    * Abstract: We propose several schemes for upper bounding the optimal value of the constrained most probable explanation (CMPE) problem. Given a set of discrete random variables, two probabilistic graphical models defined over them and a real number $q$, this problem involves finding an assignment of values to all the variables such that the probability of the assignment is maximized according to the first model and is bounded by $q$ w.r.t. the second model. In prior work, it was shown that CMPE is a unifying problem with several applications and special cases including the nearest assignment problem, the decision preserving most probable explanation task and robust estimation. It was also shown that CMPE is NP-hard even on tractable models such as bounded treewidth networks and is hard for integer linear programming methods because it includes a dense global constraint. The main idea in our approach is to simplify the problem via Lagrange relaxation and decomposition to yield either a knapsack problem or the unconstrained most probable explanation (MPE) problem, and then solving the two problems, respectively using specialized knapsack algorithms and mini-buckets based upper bounding schemes. We evaluate our proposed scheme along several dimensions including quality of the bounds and computation time required on various benchmark graphical models and how it can be used to find heuristic, near-optimal feasible solutions in an example application pertaining to robust estimation and adversarial attacks on classifiers.

    * Abstract: The problem of (point) forecasting univariate time series is considered. Most approaches, ranging from traditional statistical methods to recent learning-based techniques with neural networks, directly operate on raw time series observations. As an extension, we study whether local topological properties, as captured via persistent homology, can serve as a reliable signal that provides complementary information for learning to forecast. To this end, we propose topological attention, which allows attending to local topological features within a time horizon of historical data. Our approach easily integrates into existing end-to-end trainable forecasting models, such as N-BEATS, and, in combination with the latter exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale M4 benchmark dataset of 100,000 diverse time series from different domains. Ablation experiments, as well as a comparison to recent techniques in a setting where only a single time series is available for training, corroborate the beneficial nature of including local topological information through an attention mechanism.

    * Abstract: As the perception range of LiDAR increases, LiDAR-based 3D object detection becomes a dominant task in the long-range perception task of autonomous driving. The mainstream 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in the network backbone and prediction head. However, the computational and spatial costs on the dense feature map are quadratic to the perception range, which makes them hardly scale up to the long-range setting. To enable efficient long-range LiDAR-based object detection, we build a fully sparse 3D object detector (FSD). The computational and spatial cost of FSD is roughly linear to the number of points and independent of the perception range. FSD is built upon the general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR) module. SIR first groups the points into instances and then applies instance-wise feature extraction and prediction. In this way, SIR resolves the issue of center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully sparse architecture for all center-based or anchor-based detectors. Moreover, SIR avoids the time-consuming neighbor queries in previous point-based methods by grouping points into instances. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset to reveal the working mechanism of FSD, and state-of-the-art performance is reported. To demonstrate the superiority of FSD in long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2 Dataset, which has a much larger perception range ($200m$) than Waymo Open Dataset ($75m$). On such a large perception range, FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is 2.4$\times$ faster than the dense counterpart. Codes will be released.

    * Abstract: A shrinking market is a ubiquitous challenge faced by various industries. In this paper we formulate the first formal model of shrinking markets in multi-item settings, and study how mechanism design and machine learning can help preserve revenue in an uncertain, shrinking market. Via a sample-based learning mechanism, we prove the first guarantees on how much revenue can be preserved by truthful multi-item, multi-bidder auctions (for limited supply) when only a random unknown fraction of the population participates in the market. We first present a general reduction that converts any sufficiently rich auction class into a randomized auction robust to market shrinkage. Our main technique is a novel combinatorial construction called a winner diagram that concisely represents all possible executions of an auction on an uncertain set of bidders. Via a probabilistic analysis of winner diagrams, we derive a general possibility result: a sufficiently rich class of auctions always contains an auction that is robust to market shrinkage and market uncertainty. Our result has applications to important practically-constrained settings such as auctions with a limited number of winners. We then show how to efficiently learn an auction that is robust to market shrinkage by leveraging practically-efficient routines for solving the winner determination problem.

    * Authors: Jicong Fan, Yiheng Tu, Zhao Zhang, Mingbo Zhao, Haijun Zhang
    * Abstract: The performance of spectral clustering heavily relies on the quality of affinity matrix. A variety of affinity-matrix-construction (AMC) methods have been proposed but they have hyperparameters to determine beforehand, which requires strong experience and leads to difficulty in real applications, especially when the inter-cluster similarity is high and/or the dataset is large. In addition, we often need to choose different AMC methods for different datasets, which still depends on experience. To solve these two challenging problems, in this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for automated spectral clustering. First, we propose to find the most reliable affinity matrix via grid search or Bayesian optimization among a set of candidates given by different AMC methods with different hyperparameters, where the reliability is quantified by the \textit{relative-eigen-gap} of graph Laplacian introduced in this paper. Second, we propose a fast and accurate AMC method based on least squares representation and thresholding and prove its effectiveness theoretically. Finally, we provide a large-scale extension for the automated spectral clustering method, of which the time complexity is linear with the number of data points. Extensive experiments of natural image clustering show that our method is more versatile, accurate, and efficient than baseline methods.

    * Abstract: We study two problems related to recovering causal graphs from interventional data: (i) $\textit{verification}$, where the task is to check if a purported causal graph is correct, and (ii) $\textit{search}$, where the task is to recover the correct causal graph. For both, we wish to minimize the number of interventions performed. For the first problem, we give a characterization of a minimal sized set of atomic interventions that is necessary and sufficient to check the correctness of a claimed causal graph. Our characterization uses the notion of $\textit{covered edges}$, which enables us to obtain simple proofs and also easily reason about earlier known results. We also generalize our results to the settings of bounded size interventions and node-dependent interventional costs. For all the above settings, we provide the first known provable algorithms for efficiently computing (near)-optimal verifying sets on general graphs. For the second problem, we give a simple adaptive algorithm based on graph separators that produces an atomic intervention set which fully orients any essential graph while using $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ times the optimal number of interventions needed to $\textit{verify}$ (verifying size) the underlying DAG on $n$ vertices. This approximation is tight as $\textit{any}$ search algorithm on an essential line graph has worst case approximation ratio of $\Omega(\log n)$ with respect to the verifying size. With bounded size interventions, each of size $\leq k$, our algorithm gives an $\mathcal{O}(\log n \cdot \log k)$ factor approximation. Our result is the first known algorithm that gives a non-trivial approximation guarantee to the verifying size on general unweighted graphs and with bounded size interventions.

    * Abstract: Besides per-pixel accuracy, topological correctness is also crucial for the segmentation of images with fine-scale structures, e.g., satellite images and biomedical images. In this paper, by leveraging the theory of digital topology, we identify pixels in an image that are critical for topology. By focusing on these critical pixels, we propose a new \textbf{homotopy warping loss} to train deep image segmentation networks for better topological accuracy. To efficiently identify these topologically critical pixels, we propose a new algorithm exploiting the distance transform. The proposed algorithm, as well as the loss function, naturally generalize to different topological structures in both 2D and 3D settings. The proposed loss function helps deep nets achieve better performance in terms of topology-aware metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art structure/topology-aware segmentation methods.

    * Abstract: The hippocampus plays a critical role in learning, memory, and spatial representation, processes that depend on the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). Inspired by recent findings that compare deep learning models to the hippocampus, we propose a new nonlinear activation function that mimics NMDAR dynamics. NMDAR-like nonlinearity shifts short-term working memory into long-term reference memory in transformers, thus enhancing a process that is similar to memory consolidation in the mammalian brain. We design a navigation task assessing these two memory functions and show that manipulating the activation function (i.e., mimicking the Mg$^{2+}$-gating of NMDAR) disrupts long-term memory processes. Our experiments suggest that place cell-like functions and reference memory reside in the feed-forward network layer of transformers and that nonlinearity drives these processes. We discuss the role of NMDAR-like nonlinearity in establishing this striking resemblance between transformer architecture and hippocampal spatial representation.

    * Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various applications, but their performance can be sensitive to specific data properties of the graph datasets they operate on. Current literature on understanding the limitations of GNNs has primarily employed a \emph{model-driven} approach that leverage heuristics and domain knowledge from network science or graph theory to model the GNN behaviors, which is time-consuming and highly subjective. In this work, we propose a \emph{metadata-driven} approach to analyze the sensitivity of GNNs to graph data properties, motivated by the increasing availability of graph learning benchmarks. We perform a multivariate sparse regression analysis on the metadata derived from benchmarking GNN performance across diverse datasets, yielding a set of salient data properties. To validate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach, we focus on one identified data property, the degree distribution, and investigate how this property influences GNN performance through theoretical analysis and controlled experiments. Our theoretical findings reveal that datasets with more balanced degree distribution exhibit better linear separability of node representations, thus leading to better GNN performance. We also conduct controlled experiments using synthetic datasets with varying degree distributions, and the results align well with our theoretical findings. Collectively, both the theoretical analysis and controlled experiments verify that the proposed metadata-driven approach is effective in identifying critical data properties for GNNs.

    * Abstract: Rapidly increasing quality of AI-generated content makes it difficult to distinguish between human and AI-generated texts, which may lead to undesirable consequences for society. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to study the properties of human texts that are invariant over text domains and various proficiency of human writers, can be easily calculated for any language, and can robustly separate natural and AI-generated texts regardless of the generation model and sampling method. In this work, we propose such an invariant of human texts, namely the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold underlying the set of embeddings of a given text sample. We show that the average intrinsic dimensionality of fluent texts in natural language is hovering around the value $9$ for several alphabet-based languages and around $7$ for Chinese, while the average intrinsic dimensionality of AI-generated texts for each language is $\approx 1.5$ lower, with a clear statistical separation between human-generated and AI-generated distributions. This property allows us to build a score-based artificial text detector. The proposed detector's accuracy is stable over text domains, generator models, and human writer proficiency levels, outperforming SOTA detectors in model-agnostic and cross-domain scenarios by a significant margin.

    * Abstract: Despite the empirical success and practical significance of (relational) knowledge distillation that matches (the relations of) features between teacher and student models, the corresponding theoretical interpretations remain limited for various knowledge distillation paradigms. In this work, we take an initial step toward a theoretical understanding of relational knowledge distillation (RKD), with a focus on semi-supervised classification problems. We start by casting RKD as spectral clustering on a population-induced graph unveiled by a teacher model. Via a notion of clustering error that quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted and ground truth clusterings, we illustrate that RKD over the population provably leads to low clustering error. Moreover, we provide a sample complexity bound for RKD with limited unlabeled samples. For semi-supervised learning, we further demonstrate the label efficiency of RKD through a general framework of cluster-aware semi-supervised learning that assumes low clustering errors. Finally, by unifying data augmentation consistency regularization into this cluster-aware framework, we show that despite the common effect of learning accurate clusterings, RKD facilitates a "global" perspective through spectral clustering, whereas consistency regularization focuses on a "local" perspective via expansion.

    * Abstract: Recognizing and organizing text in correct reading order plays a crucial role in historical document analysis and preservation. While existing methods have shown promising performance, they often struggle with challenges such as diverse layouts, low image quality, style variations, and distortions. This is primarily due to the lack of consideration for these issues in the current benchmarks, which hinders the development and evaluation of historical document analysis and recognition (HDAR) methods in complex real-world scenarios. To address this gap, this paper introduces a complex multi-style Chinese historical document analysis benchmark, named M5HisDoc. The M5 indicates five properties of style, ie., Multiple layouts, Multiple document types, Multiple calligraphy styles, Multiple backgrounds, and Multiple challenges. The M5HisDoc dataset consists of two subsets, M5HisDoc-R (Regular) and M5HisDoc-H (Hard). The M5HisDoc-R subset comprises 4,000 historical document images. To ensure high-quality annotations, we meticulously perform manual annotation and triple-checking. To replicate real-world conditions for historical document analysis applications, we incorporate image rotation, distortion, and resolution reduction into M5HisDoc-R subset to form a new challenging subset named M5HisDoc-H, which contains the same number of images as M5HisDoc-R. The dataset exhibits diverse styles, significant scale variations, dense texts, and an extensive character set. We conduct benchmarking experiments on five tasks: text line detection, text line recognition, character detection, character recognition, and reading order prediction. We also conduct cross-validation with other benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that the M5HisDoc dataset can offer new challenges and great opportunities for future research in this field, thereby providing deep insights into the solution for HDAR.

    * Abstract: Shadows encode a powerful geometric cue: if one pixel casts a shadow onto another, then the two pixels are colinear with the lighting direction. Given many images over many lighting directions, this constraint can be leveraged to recover the depth of a scene from a single viewpoint. For outdoor scenes with solar illumination, we term this the episolar constraint, which provides a convex optimization to solve for the sparse depth of a scene from shadow correspondences, a method to reduce the search space when finding shadow correspondences, and a method to geometrically calibrate a camera using shadow constraints. Our method constructs a dense network of nonlocal constraints which complements recent work on outdoor photometric stereo and cloud based cues for 3D. We demonstrate results across a variety of time-lapse sequences from webcams "in the wild.

    * Abstract: State-of-the-art Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms deliver dense depth maps or complex meshes with very high detail, and redundancy over regular surfaces. In turn, our interest lies in an approximate, but light-weight method that is better to consider for large-scale applications, such as urban scene reconstruction from ground-based images. We present a novel approach for producing dense reconstructions from multiple images and from the underlying sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) data in an efficient way. To overcome the problem of SfM sparsity and textureless areas, we assume piecewise planarity of man-made scenes and exploit both sparse visibility and a fast over-segmentation of the images. Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-driven, multi-view plane assignment problem, which we solve jointly over superpixels from all views while avoiding expensive photoconsistency computations. The resulting planar primitives -- defined by detailed superpixel boundaries -- are computed in about 10 seconds per image.

    * Abstract: This work proposes a method to interpret a scene by assigning a semantic label at every pixel and inferring the spatial extent of individual object instances together with their occlusion relationships. Starting with an initial pixel labeling and a set of candidate object masks for a given test image, we select a subset of objects that explain the image well and have valid overlap relationships and occlusion ordering. This is done by minimizing an integer quadratic program either using a greedy method or a standard solver. Then we alternate between using the object predictions to refine the pixel labels and vice versa. The proposed system obtains promising results on two challenging subsets of the LabelMe and SUN datasets, the largest of which contains 45,676 images and 232 classes.

    * Abstract: We develop a sequential optimal sampling framework for stereo disparity estimation by adapting the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) model. We operate over local image neighborhoods by iteratively estimating single pixel disparity values until sufficient evidence has been gathered to either validate or contradict the current hypothesis regarding local scene structure. The output of our sampling is a set of sampled pixel positions along with a robust and compact estimate of the set of disparities contained within a given region. We further propose an efficient plane propagation mechanism that leverages the pre-computed sampling positions and the local structure model described by the reduced local disparity set. Our sampling framework is a general pre-processing mechanism aimed at reducing computational complexity of disparity search algorithms by ascertaining a reduced set of disparity hypotheses for each pixel. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when compared to state of the art methods.

    * Abstract: Large-scale Structure-from-Motion systems typically spend major computational effort on pairwise image matching and geometric verification in order to discover connected components in large-scale, unordered image collections. In recent years, the research community has spent significant effort on improving the efficiency of this stage. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of various state-of-the-art methods, evaluating and analyzing their performance. Based on the insights of this evaluation, we propose a learning-based approach, the PAirwise Image Geometry Encoding (PAIGE), to efficiently identify image pairs with scene overlap without the need to perform exhaustive putative matching and geometric verification. PAIGE achieves state-of-the-art performance and integrates well into existing Structure-from-Motion pipelines.

    * Abstract: Fisheye image rectification and estimation of intrinsic parameters for real scenes have been addressed in the literature by using line information on the distorted images. In this paper, we propose an easily implemented fisheye image rectification algorithm with line constrains in the undistorted perspective image plane. A novel Multi-Label Energy Optimization (MLEO) method is adopted to merge short circular arcs sharing the same or the approximately same circular parameters and select long circular arcs for camera rectification. Further we propose an efficient method to estimate intrinsic parameters of the fisheye camera by automatically selecting three properly arranged long circular arcs from previously obtained circular arcs in the calibration procedure. Experimental results on a number of real images and simulated data show that the proposed method can achieve good results and outperforms the existing approaches and the commercial software in most cases.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for semantic parsing the 3D point cloud of an entire building using a hierarchical approach: first, the raw data is parsed into semantically meaningful spaces (e.g. rooms, etc) that are aligned into a canonical reference coordinate system. Second, the spaces are parsed into their structural and building elements (e.g. walls, columns, etc). Performing these with a strong notation of global 3D space is the backbone of our method. The alignment in the first step injects strong 3D priors from the canonical coordinate system into the second step for dis- covering elements. This allows diverse challenging scenarios as man-made indoor spaces often show recurrent geo- metric patterns while the appearance features can change drastically. We also argue that identification of structural elements in indoor spaces is essentially a detection problem, rather than segmentation which is commonly used. We evaluated our method on a new dataset of several buildings with a covered area of over 6, 000m2 and over 215 million points, demonstrating robust results readily useful for practical applications.

    * Abstract: Internet photo collections naturally contain a large variety of illumination conditions, with the largest difference between day and night images. Current modeling techniques do not embrace the broad illumination range often leading to reconstruction failure or severe artifacts. We present an algorithm that leverages the appearance variety to obtain more complete and accurate scene geometry along with consistent multi-illumination appearance information. The proposed method relies on automatic scene appearance grouping, which is used to obtain separate dense 3D models. Subsequent model fusion combines the separate models into a complete and accurate reconstruction of the scene. In addition, we propose a method to derive the appearance information for the model under the different illumination conditions, even for scene parts that are not observed under one illumination condition. To achieve this, we develop a cross-illumination color transfer technique. We evaluate our method on a large variety of landmarks from across Europe reconstructed from a database of 7.4M images.

    * Abstract: We propose a new technique to jointly recover cosegmentation and dense per-pixel correspondence in two images. Our method parameterizes the correspondence field using piecewise similarity transformations and recovers a mapping between the estimated common "foreground" regions in the two images allowing them to be precisely aligned. Our formulation is based on a hierarchical Markov random field model with segmentation and transformation labels. The hierarchical structure uses nested image regions to constrain inference across multiple scales. Unlike prior hierarchical methods which assume that the structure is given, our proposed iterative technique dynamically recovers the structure as a variable along with the labeling. This joint inference is performed in an energy minimization framework using iterated graph cuts. We evaluate our method on a new dataset of 400 image pairs with manually obtained ground truth, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods designed specifically for either cosegmentation or correspondence estimation.

    * Authors: Siyu Zhu, Richard Zanibbi
    * Abstract: We propose a system that finds text in natural scenes using a variety of cues. Our novel data-driven method incorporates coarse-to-fine detection of character pixels using convolutional features (Text-Conv), followed by extracting connected components (CCs) from characters using edge and color features, and finally performing a graph-based segmentation of CCs into words (Word-Graph). For Text-Conv, the initial detection is based on convolutional feature maps similar to those used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but learned using Convolutional k-means. Convolution masks defined by local and neighboring patch features are used to improve detection accuracy. The Word-Graph algorithm uses contextual information to both improve word segmentation and prune false character/word detections. Different definitions for foreground (text) regions are used to train the detection stages, some based on bounding box intersection, and others on bounding box and pixel intersection. Our system obtains pixel, character, and word detection f-measures of 93.14%, 90.26%, and 86.77% respectively for the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Focused Scene Text dataset, out-performing state-of-the-art systems. This approach may work for other detection targets with homogenous color in natural scenes.

    * Abstract: Most state-of-the-art text detection methods are specific to horizontal Latin text and are not fast enough for real-time applications. We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decompose text into two locally detectable elements, namely segments and links. A segment is an oriented box covering a part of a word or text line; A link connects two adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural network. Final detections are produced by combining segments connected by links. Compared with previous methods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75.0% on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512x512 images. Moreover, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese.

    * Abstract: Large-scale training for semantic segmentation is challenging due to the expense of obtaining training data for this task relative to other vision tasks. We propose a novel training approach to address this difficulty. Given cheaply-obtained sparse image labelings, we propagate the sparse labels to produce guessed dense labelings. A standard CNN-based segmentation network is trained to mimic these labelings. The label-propagation process is defined via random-walk hitting probabilities, which leads to a differentiable parameterization with uncertainty estimates that are incorporated into our loss. We show that by learning the label-propagator jointly with the segmentation predictor, we are able to effectively learn semantic edges given no direct edge supervision. Experiments also show that training a segmentation network in this way outperforms the naive approach.

We consider document semantic structure extraction as a pixel-wise segmentation task, and propose a unified model that classifies pixels based not only on their visual appearance, as in the traditional page segmentation task, but also on the content of underlying text. Moreover, we propose an efficient synthetic document generation process that we use to generate pretraining data for our network. Once the network is trained on a large set of synthetic documents, we fine-tune the network on unlabeled real documents using a semi-supervised approach. We systematically study the optimum network architecture and show that both our multimodal approach and the synthetic data pretraining significantly boost the performance.

Our architecture builds upon and revisits temporal match kernels within neural networks: we propose a new temporal layer that finds temporal alignments by maximizing the scores between two sequences of vectors, according to a time-sensitive similarity metric parametrized in the Fourier domain. We learn this layer with a temporal proposal strategy, in which we minimize a triplet loss that takes into account both the localization accuracy and the recognition rate. We evaluate our approach on video alignment, copy detection and event retrieval. Our approach outperforms the state on the art on temporal video alignment and video copy detection datasets in comparable setups. It also attains the best reported results for particular event search, while precisely aligning videos.

    * Abstract: Convolutional networks are the de-facto standard for analyzing spatio-temporal data such as images, videos, and 3D shapes. Whilst some of this data is naturally dense (e.g., photos), many other data sources are inherently sparse. Examples include 3D point clouds that were obtained using a LiDAR scanner or RGB-D camera. Standard ``dense'' implementations of convolutional networks are very inefficient when applied on such sparse data. We introduce new sparse convolutional operations that are designed to process spatially-sparse data more efficiently, and use them to develop spatially-sparse convolutional networks. We demonstrate the strong performance of the resulting models, called submanifold sparse convolutional networks (SSCNs), on two tasks involving semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds. In particular, our models outperform all prior state-of-the-art on the test set of a recent semantic segmentation competition.

    * Abstract: Object detection in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) has drawn the attention of the computer vision research community for a number of years. WAMI proposes a number of unique challenges including extremely small object sizes, both sparse and densely-packed objects, and extremely large search spaces (large video frames). Nearly all state-of-the-art methods in WAMI object detection report that appearance-based classifiers fail in this challenging data and instead rely almost entirely on motion information in the form of background subtraction or frame-differencing. In this work, we experimentally verify the failure of appearance-based classifiers in WAMI, such as Faster R-CNN and a heatmap-based fully convolutional neural network (CNN), and propose a novel two-stage spatio-temporal CNN which effectively and efficiently combines both appearance and motion information to significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in WAMI object detection. To reduce the large search space, the first stage (ClusterNet) takes in a set of extremely large video frames, combines the motion and appearance information within the convolutional architecture, and proposes regions of objects of interest (ROOBI). These ROOBI can contain from one to clusters of several hundred objects due to the large video frame size and varying object density in WAMI. The second stage (FoveaNet) then estimates the centroid location of all objects in that given ROOBI simultaneously via heatmap estimation. The proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art results on the WPAFB 2009 dataset by 5-16% for moving objects and nearly 50% for stopped objects, as well as being the first proposed method in wide area motion imagery to detect completely stationary objects.

SPGs offer a compact yet rich representation of contextual relationships between object parts, which is then exploited by a graph convolutional network. Our framework sets a new state of the art for segmenting outdoor LiDAR scans (+11.9 and +8.8 mIoU points for both Semantic3D test sets), as well as indoor scans (+12.4 mIoU points for the S3DIS dataset).

    * Abstract: Delineation of curvilinear structures is an important problem in Computer Vision with multiple practical applications. With the advent of Deep Learning, many current approaches on automatic delineation have focused on finding more powerful deep architectures, but have continued using the habitual pixel-wise losses such as binary cross-entropy. In this paper we claim that pixel-wise losses alone are unsuitable for this problem because of their inability to reflect the topological importance of prediction errors. Instead, we propose a new loss term that is aware of the higher-order topological features of the linear structures. We also introduce a refinement pipeline that iteratively applies the same model over the previous delineation to refine the predictions at each step while keeping the number of parameters and the complexity of the model constant. When combined with the standard pixel-wise loss, both our new loss term and iterative refinement boost the quality of the predicted delineations, in some cases almost doubling the accuracy as compared to the same classifier trained only with the binary cross-entropy. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of data, from microscopy to aerial images.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learning instance segmentation with image-level class labels as supervision. Our approach generates pseudo instance segmentation labels of training images, which are used to train a fully supervised model. For generating the pseudo labels, we first identify confident seed areas of object classes from attention maps of an image classification model, and propagate them to discover the entire instance areas with accurate boundaries. To this end, we propose IRNet, which estimates rough areas of individual instances and detects boundaries between different object classes. It thus enables to assign instance labels to the seeds and to propagate them within the boundaries so that the entire areas of instances can be estimated accurately. Furthermore, IRNet is trained with inter-pixel relations on the attention maps, thus no extra supervision is required. Our method with IRNet achieves an outstanding performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing not only previous state-of-the-art trained with the same level of supervision, but also some of previous models relying on stronger supervision.

We propose persistency criteria for the multicut and max-cut problem as well as fast combinatorial routines to verify them. The criteria that we derive are based on mappings that improve feasible multicuts, respectively cuts. Our elementary criteria can be checked enumeratively. The more advanced ones rely on fast algorithms for upper and lower bounds for the respective cut problems and max-flow techniques for auxiliary min-cut problems. Our methods can be used as a preprocessing technique for reducing problem sizes or for computing partial optimality guarantees for solutions output by heuristic solvers. We show the efficacy of our methods on instances of both problems from computer vision, biomedical image analysis and statistical physics.

    * Abstract: Pixel-accurate tracking of objects is a key element in many computer vision applications, often solved by iterated individual object tracking or instance segmentation followed by object matching. Here we introduce cross-classification clustering (3C), a technique that simultaneously tracks complex, interrelated objects in an image stack. The key idea in cross-classification is to efficiently turn a clustering problem into a classification problem by running a logarithmic number of independent classifications per image, letting the cross-labeling of these classifications uniquely classify each pixel to the object labels. We apply the 3C mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in connectomics -- the nanoscale mapping of neural tissue from electron microscopy volumes. Our reconstruction system increases scalability by an order of magnitude over existing single-object tracking methods (such as flood-filling networks). This scalability is important for the deployment of connectomics pipelines, since currently the best performing techniques require computing infrastructures that are beyond the reach of most laboratories. Our algorithm may offer benefits in other domains that require pixel-accurate tracking of multiple objects, such as segmentation of videos and medical imagery.

    * Authors: Saquib Sarfraz,  Vivek Sharma,  Rainer Stiefelhagen
    * Abstract: We present a new clustering method in the form of a single clustering equation that is able to directly discover groupings in the data. The main proposition is that the first neighbor of each sample is all one needs to discover large chains and finding the groups in the data. In contrast to most existing clustering algorithms our method does not require any hyper-parameters, distance thresholds and/or the need to specify the number of clusters. The proposed algorithm belongs to the family of hierarchical agglomerative methods. The technique has a very low computational overhead, is easily scalable and applicable to large practical problems. Evaluation on well known datasets from different domains ranging between 1077 and 8.1 million samples shows substantial performance gains when compared to the existing clustering techniques.

    * Abstract: Learning with complete or partial supervision is power- ful but relies on ever-growing human annotation efforts. As a way to mitigate this serious problem, as well as to serve specific applications, unsupervised learning has emerged as an important field of research. In computer vision, unsu- pervised learning comes in various guises. We focus here on the unsupervised discovery and matching of object cate- gories among images in a collection, following the work of Cho et al. [12]. We show that the original approach can be reformulated and solved as a proper optimization problem. Experiments on several benchmarks establish the merit of our approach.

    * Abstract: Persistence diagram (PD) has been considered as a compact descriptor for topological data analysis (TDA). Unfortunately, PD cannot be directly used in machine learning methods since it is a multiset of points. Recent efforts have been devoted to transforming PDs into vectors to accommodate machine learning methods. However, they share one common shortcoming: the mapping of PDs to a feature representation depends on a pre-defined polynomial. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an algebraic representation for PDs, i.e., polynomial representation. In this work, we discover a set of general polynomials that vanish on vectorized PDs and extract the task-adapted feature representation from these polynomials. We also prove two attractive properties of the proposed polynomial representation, i.e., stability and linear separability. Experiments also show that our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art TDA methods.

    * Abstract: Face recognition sees remarkable progress in recent years, and its performance has reached a very high level. Taking it to a next level requires substantially larger data, which would involve prohibitive annotation cost. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data becomes an appealing alternative. Recent works have shown that clustering unlabeled faces is a promising approach, often leading to notable performance gains. Yet, how to effectively cluster, especially on a large-scale (i.e. million-level or above) dataset, remains an open question. A key challenge lies in the complex variations of cluster patterns, which make it difficult for conventional clustering methods to meet the needed accuracy. This work explores a novel approach, namely, learning to cluster instead of relying on hand-crafted criteria. Specifically, we propose a framework based on graph convolutional network, which combines a detection and a segmentation module to pinpoint face clusters. Experiments show that our method yields significantly more accurate face clusters, which, as a result, also lead to further performance gain in face recognition.

    * Abstract: Optimizing a network of maps among a collection of objects/domains (or map synchronization) is a central problem across computer vision and many other relevant fields. Compared to optimizing pairwise maps in isolation, the benefit of map synchronization is that there are natural constraints among a map network that can improve the quality of individual maps. While such self-supervision constraints are well-understood for undirected map networks (e.g., the cycle-consistency constraint), they are under-explored for directed map networks, which naturally arise when maps are given by parametric maps (e.g., a feed-forward neural network). In this paper, we study a natural self-supervision constraint for directed map networks called path-invariance, which enforces that composite maps along different paths between a fixed pair of source and target domains are identical. We introduce path-invariance bases for efficient encoding of the path-invariance constraint and present an algorithm that outputs a path-variance basis with polynomial time and space complexities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation on optimizing object correspondences, estimating dense image maps via neural networks, and 3D scene segmentation via map networks of diverse 3D representations. In particular, our approach only requires 8% labeled data from ScanNet to achieve the same performance as training a single 3D semantic segmentation network with 30% to 100% labeled data.

    * Abstract: Global methods to Structure from Motion have gained popularity in recent years. A significant drawback of global methods is their sensitivity to collinear camera settings. In this paper, we introduce an analysis and algorithms for averaging bifocal tensors (essential or fundamental matrices) when either subsets or all of the camera centers are collinear. We provide a complete spectral characterization of bifocal tensors in collinear scenarios and further propose two averaging algorithms. The first algorithm uses rank constrained minimization to recover camera matrices in fully collinear settings. The second algorithm enriches the set of possibly mixed collinear and non-collinear cameras with additional, "virtual cameras," which are placed in general position, enabling the application of existing averaging methods to the enriched set of bifocal tensors. Our algorithms are shown to achieve state of the art results on various benchmarks that include autonomous car datasets and unordered image collections in both calibrated and unclibrated settings.

    * Abstract: 3D instance segmentation plays a predominant role in environment perception of robotics and augmented reality. Many deep learning based methods have been presented recently for this task. These methods rely on either a detection branch to propose objects or a grouping step to assemble same-instance points. However, detection based methods do not ensure a consistent instance label for each point, while the grouping step requires parameter-tuning and is computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to enable end-to-end instance segmentation without detection and a separate step of grouping. The core idea is to convert instance segmentation to a candidate assignment problem. At first, a set of instance candidates is sampled. Then we propose an assignment module for candidate assignment and a suppression module to eliminate redundant candidates. A mapping between instance labels and instance candidates is further sought to construct an instance grouping loss for the network training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than previous approaches.

    * Abstract: Textual information in a captured scene plays an important role in scene interpretation and decision making. Though there exist methods that can successfully detect and interpret complex text regions present in a scene, to the best of our knowledge, there is no significant prior work that aims to modify the textual information in an image. The ability to edit text directly on images has several advantages including error correction, text restoration and image reusability. In this paper, we propose a method to modify text in an image at character-level. We approach the problem in two stages. At first, the unobserved character (target) is generated from an observed character (source) being modified. We propose two different neural network architectures - (a) FANnet to achieve structural consistency with source font and (b) Colornet to preserve source color. Next, we replace the source character with the generated character maintaining both geometric and visual consistency with neighboring characters. Our method works as a unified platform for modifying text in images. We present the effectiveness of our method on COCO-Text and ICDAR datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively.

    * Abstract: The core of our approach, Pixel Consensus Voting, is a framework for instance segmentation based on the generalized Hough transform. Pixels cast discretized, probabilistic votes for the likely regions that contain instance centroids. At the detected peaks that emerge in the voting heatmap, backprojection is applied to collect pixels and produce instance masks. Unlike a sliding window detector that densely enumerates object proposals, our method detects instances as a result of the consensus among pixel-wise votes. We implement vote aggregation and backprojection using native operators of a convolutional neural network. The discretization of centroid voting reduces the training of instance segmentation to pixel labeling, analogous and complementary to FCN-style semantic segmentation, leading to an efficient and unified architecture that jointly models things and stuff. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline on COCO and Cityscapes Panoptic Segmentation and obtain competitive results. Code will be open-sourced.

    * Abstract: Face clustering is an essential tool for exploiting the unlabeled face data, and has a wide range of applications including face annotation and retrieval. Recent works show that supervised clustering can result in noticeable performance gain. However, they usually involve heuristic steps and require numerous overlapped subgraphs, severely restricting their accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a fully learnable clustering framework without requiring a large number of overlapped subgraphs. Instead, we transform the clustering problem into two sub-problems. Specifically, two graph convolutional networks, named GCN-V and GCN-E, are designed to estimate the confidence of vertices and the connectivity of edges, respectively. With the vertex confidence and edge connectivity, we can naturally organize more relevant vertices on the affinity graph and group them into clusters. Experiments on two large-scale benchmarks show that our method significantly improves clustering accuracy and thus performance of the recognition models trained on top, yet it is an order of magnitude more efficient than existing supervised methods.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel, simple yet robust self-representation method, i.e., Double Low-Rank Representation with Projection Distance penalty (DLRRPD) for clustering. With the learned optimal projected representations, DLRRPD is capable of obtaining an effective similarity graph to capture the multi-subspace structure. Besides the global low-rank constraint, the local geometrical structure is additionally exploited via a projection distance penalty in our DLRRPD, thus facilitating a more favorable graph. Moreover, to improve the robustness of DLRRPD to noises, we introduce a Laplacian rank constraint, which can further encourage the learned graph to be more discriminative for clustering tasks. Meanwhile, Frobenius norm (instead of the popularly used nuclear norm) is employed to enforce the graph to be more block-diagonal with lower complexity. Extensive experiments have been conducted on synthetic, real, and noisy data to show that the proposed method outperforms currently available alternatives by a margin of 1.0% 10.1%.

    * Abstract: We present Picasso, a CUDA-based library comprising novel modules for deep learning over complex real-world 3D meshes. Hierarchical neural architectures have proved effective in multi-scale feature extraction which signifies the need for fast mesh decimation. However, existing methods rely on CPU-based implementations to obtain multi-resolution meshes. We design GPU-accelerated mesh decimation to facilitate network resolution reduction efficiently on-the-fly. Pooling and unpooling modules are defined on the vertex clusters gathered during decimation. For feature learning over meshes, Picasso contains three types of novel convolutions namely, facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and facet2facet convolution. Hence, it treats a mesh as a geometric structure comprising vertices and facets, rather than a spacial graph with edges as previous methods do. Picasso also incorporates a fuzzy mechanism in its filters for robustness to mesh sampling (vertex density). It exploits Gaussian mixtures to define fuzzy coefficients for the facet2vertex convolution, and barycentric interpolation to define the coefficients for the remaining two convolutions. In this release, we demonstrate the effectivenss of the proposed modules with competitive segmentation results on S3DIS. The library will be made public through github.

    * Abstract: Multi-Camera Multiple Object Tracking (MC-MOT) is a significant computer vision problem due to its emerging applicability in several real-world applications. Despite a large number of existing works, solving the data association problem in any MC-MOT pipeline is arguably one of the most challenging tasks. Developing a robust MC-MOT system, however, is still highly challenging due to many practical issues such as inconsistent lighting conditions, varying object movement patterns, or the trajectory occlusions of the objects between the cameras. To address these problems, this work, therefore, proposes a new Dynamic Graph Model with Link Prediction (DyGLIP) approach to solve the data association task. Compared to existing methods, our new model offers several advantages, including better feature representations and the ability to recover from lost tracks during camera transitions. Moreover, our model works gracefully regardless of the overlapping ratios between the cameras. Experimental results show that we outperform existing MC-MOT algorithms by a large margin on several practical datasets. Notably, our model works favorably on online settings but can be extended to an incremental approach for large-scale datasets.

    * Abstract: Instance segmentation, the task of identifying and separating each individual object of interest in the image, is one of the actively studied research topics in computer vision. Although many feed-forward networks produce high-quality binary segmentation on different types of images, their final result heavily relies on the post-processing step, which separates instances from the binary mask. In comparison, the existing iterative methods extract a single object at a time using discriminative knowledge-based properties (e.g., shapes, boundaries, etc.) without relying on post-processing. However, they do not scale well with a large number of objects. To exploit the advantages of conventional sequential segmentation methods without impairing the scalability, we propose a novel iterative deep reinforcement learning agent that learns how to differentiate multiple objects in parallel. By constructing a relational graph between pixels, we design a reward function that encourages separating pixels of different objects and grouping pixels that belong to the same instance. We demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently perform instance segmentation of many objects without heavy post-processing.

    * Abstract: We propose a machine learning based approach for automatic 3D building reconstruction and vectorization. Taking a single-channel photogrammetric digital surface model (DSM) and panchromatic (PAN) image as input, we first filter out non-building objects and refine the building shapes of input DSM with a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). The refined DSM and the input PAN image are then used through a semantic segmentation network to detect edges and corners of building roofs. Later, a set of vectorization algorithms are proposed to build roof polygons. Finally, the height information from the refined DSM is added to the polygons to obtain a fully vectorized level of detail (LoD)-2 building model. We verify the effectiveness of our method on large-scale satellite images, where we obtain state-of-the-art performance.

    * Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based video text spotting has been extensively used in civil and military domains. UAV's limited battery capacity motivates us to develop an energy-efficient video text spotting solution. In this paper, we first revisit RCNN's crop & resize training strategy and empirically find that it outperforms aligned RoI sampling on a real-world video text dataset captured by UAV. To reduce energy consumption, we further propose a multi-stage image processor that takes videos' redundancy, continuity, and mixed degradation into account. The model is pruned and quantized before deployed on Raspberry Pi. Our proposed energy-efficient video text spotting solution, dubbed as E^2VTS, outperforms all previous methods by achieving a competitive tradeoff between energy efficiency and performance.

    * Abstract: Clustering is a popular approach to detecting patterns in unlabeled data. Existing clustering methods typically treat samples in a dataset as points in a metric space and compute distances to group together similar points. In this paper, we present a different way of clustering points in 2-dimensional space, inspired by how humans cluster data: by training neural networks to perform instance segmentation on plotted data. Our approach, Visual Clustering, has several advantages over traditional clustering algorithms: it is much faster than most existing clustering algorithms (making it suitable for very large datasets), it agrees strongly with human intuition for clusters, and it is by default hyperparameter free (although additional steps with hyperparameters can be introduced for more control of the algorithm). We describe the method and compare it to ten other clustering methods on synthetic data to illustrate its advantages and disadvantages. We then demonstrate how our approach can be extended to higher-dimensional data and illustrate its performance on real-world data. Our implementation of Visual Clustering is publicly available as a python package that can be installed and used on any dataset in a few lines of code. A demo on synthetic datasets is provided.

    * Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches to ObjectGoal navigation (ObjectNav) rely on reinforcement learning and typically require significant computational resources and time for learning. We propose Potential functions for ObjectGoal Navigation with Interaction-free learning (PONI), a modular approach that disentangles the skills of 'where to look?' for an object and 'how to navigate to (x, y)?'. Our key insight is that 'where to look?' can be treated purely as a perception problem, and learned without environment interactions. To address this, we propose a network that predicts two complementary potential functions conditioned on a semantic map and uses them to decide where to look for an unseen object. We train the potential function network using supervised learning on a passive dataset of top-down semantic maps, and integrate it into a modular framework to perform ObjectNav. Experiments on Gibson and Matterport3D demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art for ObjectNav while incurring up to 1,600x less computational cost for training. Code and pre-trained models are available.

    * Abstract: Transformers trained with self-supervision using self-distillation loss (DINO) have been shown to produce attention maps that highlight salient foreground objects. In this paper, we show a graph-based method that uses the self-supervised transformer features to discover an object from an image. Visual tokens are viewed as nodes in a weighted graph with edges representing a connectivity score based on the similarity of tokens. Foreground objects can then be segmented using a normalized graph-cut to group self-similar regions. We solve the graph-cut problem using spectral clustering with generalized eigen-decomposition and show that the second smallest eigenvector provides a cutting solution since its absolute value indicates the likelihood that a token belongs to a foreground object. Despite its simplicity, this approach significantly boosts the performance of unsupervised object discovery: we improve over the recent state-of-the-art LOST by a margin of 6.9%, 8.1%, and 8.1% respectively on the VOC07, VOC12, and COCO20K. The performance can be further improved by adding a second stage class-agnostic detector (CAD). Our proposed method can be easily extended to unsupervised saliency detection and weakly supervised object detection. For unsupervised saliency detection, we improve IoU for 4.9%, 5.2%, 12.9% on ECSSD, DUTS, DUTOMRON respectively compared to state-of-the-art. For weakly supervised object detection, we achieve competitive performance on CUB and ImageNet. Our code is available at: https://www.m-psi.fr/Papers/TokenCut2022/

    * Authors: Dongliang Cao, Florian Bernard
    * Abstract: The matching of 3D shapes has been extensively studied for shapes represented as surface meshes, as well as for shapes represented as point clouds. While point clouds are a common representation of raw real-world 3D data (e.g. from laser scanners), meshes encode rich and expressive topological information, but their creation typically requires some form of (often manual) curation. In turn, methods that purely rely on point clouds are unable to meet the matching quality of mesh-based methods that utilise the additional topological structure. In this work we close this gap by introducing a self-supervised multimodal learning strategy that combines mesh-based functional map regularisation with a contrastive loss that couples mesh and point cloud data. Our shape matching approach allows to obtain intramodal correspondences for triangle meshes, complete point clouds, and partially observed point clouds, as well as correspondences across these data modalities. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets even in comparison to recent supervised methods, and that our method reaches previously unseen cross-dataset generalisation ability.

    * Abstract: Graph-based multi-view clustering has attracted extensive attention because of the powerful clustering-structure representation ability and noise robustness. Considering the reality of a large amount of incomplete data, in this paper, we propose a simple but effective method for incomplete multi-view clustering based on consensus graph learning, termed as HCLS_CGL. Unlike existing methods that utilize graph constructed from raw data to aid in the learning of consistent representation, our method directly learns a consensus graph across views for clustering. Specifically, we design a novel confidence graph and embed it to form a confidence structure driven consensus graph learning model. Our confidence graph is based on an intuitive similar-nearest-neighbor hypothesis, which does not require any additional information and can help the model to obtain a high-quality consensus graph for better clustering. Numerous experiments are performed to confirm the effectiveness of our method.

    * Abstract: We tackle semi-supervised object detection based on motion cues. Recent results suggest that heuristic-based clustering methods in conjunction with object trackers can be used to pseudo-label instances of moving objects and use these as supervisory signals to train 3D object detectors in Lidar data without manual supervision. We re-think this approach and suggest that both object detection as well as motion-inspired pseudo-labeling can be tackled in a data-driven manner. We leverage recent advances in scene flow estimation to obtain point trajectories from which we extract long-term class-agnostic motion patterns. Revisiting correlation clustering in the context of message passing networks we learn to group those motion patterns to cluster points to object instances. By estimating the full extent of the objects we obtain per-scan 3D bounding boxes that we use to supervise a Lidar object detection network. Our method not only outperforms prior heuristic-based approaches (57.5 AP +14 improvement over prior work) more importantly we show we can pseudo-label and train object detectors across datasets.

    * Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have long set the state-of-the-art in skeleton-based action recognition leveraging their ability to unravel the complex dynamics of human joint topology through the graph's adjacency matrix. However an inherent flaw has come to light in these cutting-edge models: they tend to optimize the adjacency matrix jointly with the model weights. This process while seemingly efficient causes a gradual decay of bone connectivity data resulting in a model indifferent to the very topology it sought to represent. To remedy this we propose a two-fold strategy: (1) We introduce an innovative approach that encodes bone connectivity by harnessing the power of graph distances to describe the physical topology; we further incorporate action-specific topological representation via persistent homology analysis to depict systemic dynamics. This preserves the vital topological nuances often lost in conventional GCNs. (2) Our investigation also reveals the redundancy in existing GCNs for multi-relational modeling which we address by proposing an efficient refinement to Graph Convolutions (GC) - the BlockGC. This significantly reduces parameters while improving performance beyond original GCNs. Our full model BlockGCN establishes new benchmarks in skeleton-based action recognition across all model categories. Its high accuracy and lightweight design most notably on the large-scale NTU RGB+D 120 dataset stand as strong validation of the efficacy of BlockGCN.

    * Abstract: In this paper we address the challenge of selecting an optimal dataset from a source pool with annotations to enhance performance on a target dataset derived from a different source. This is important in scenarios where it is hard to afford on-the-fly dataset annotation and is also the theme of the second Visual Data Understanding (VDU) Challenge. Our solution the Classifier Guided Cluster Density Reduction (CCDR) framework operates in two stages. Initially we employ a filtering technique to identify images that align with the target dataset's distribution. Subsequently we implement a graph-based cluster density reduction method steered by a classifier that approximates the distance between the target distribution and source distribution. This classifier is trained to distinguish between images that resemble the target dataset and those that do not facilitating the pruning process shown in Figure 1. Our approach maintains a balance between selecting pertinent images that match the target distribution and eliminating redundant ones that do not contribute to the enhancement of the detection model. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over various baselines in object detection tasks particularly in optimizing the training set distribution on the region100 dataset. We have released our code here: https://github.com/himsR/DataCVChallenge-2024/tree/main

    * Abstract: Recently, instant level labeling for supervised machine learning requires a considerable number of filled masks. In this paper, we propose an efficient automatic region filling algorithm for complicated regions. Distinguishing between adjacent connected regions, the Main Filling Process scans through all pixels and fills all the pixels except boundary ones with either exterior or interior label color. In this way, we succeed in classifying all the pixels inside the region except boundary ones in the given image to form two groups: a background group and a mask group. We then set all exterior label pixels to background color, and interior label pixels to mask color. With this algorithm, we are able to generate output masks precisely and efficiently even for complicated regions as long as boundary pixels are given. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can generate precise masks that allow for various machine learning tasks such as supervised training. This algorithm can effectively handle multiple regions, complicated `holes' and regions whose boundaries touch the image border. By testing the algorithm on both toy and practical images, we show that the performance of Scan-flood Fill(SCAFF) has achieved favorable results.

    * Abstract: The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a recent trend in field based plant phenotyping data collection. However, UAVs often provide low spatial resolution images when flying at high altitudes. This can be an issue when extracting individual leaves from these images. Leaf segmentation is even more challenging because of densely overlapping leaves. Segmentation of leaf instances in the UAV images can be used to measure various phenotypic traits such as leaf length, maximum leaf width, and leaf area index. Successful leaf segmentation accurately detects leaf edges. Popular deep neural network approaches have loss functions that do not consider the spatial accuracy of the segmentation near an object's edge. This paper proposes a shape-based leaf segmentation method that segments leaves using continuous functions and produces precise contours for the leaf edges. Experimental results prove the feasibility of the method and demonstrate better performance than the Mask R-CNN.

We propose a people counting system which uses a low-resolution thermal sensor. Unlike previous thermal sensor based people counting systems, we use an overhead tripwire configuration at entryways to detect and track transient entries or exits. We develop two people counting algorithms for this system configuration. To evaluate our algorithms we have collected and labeled a low-resolution thermal video dataset with the proposed system configuration. The dataset, which is the largest of its kind, will be published alongside the paper. We also propose new evaluation metrics that are more suitable for systems that are subject to drift and jitter.

    * Abstract: We propose a fully unsupervised method for abnormal activity detection in crowded scenes. Neither normal nor abnormal training examples are needed before detection. By observing that in crowded scenes, normal activities are the behaviors performed by the majority of people and abnormalities are behaviors that occur rarely and are different from most others, we propose to use a scan statistic method to solve the problem. It scans a video with windows of variable shape and size. The abnormality of each window is measured by a likelihood ratio test statistic, which compares two hypotheses about whether or not the characteristics of the observations inside and outside the window are different. A semiparametric density ratio method is used to model the observations, which is applicable to a wide variety of data. To reduce the search complexity of the sliding window based scanning, a fast two-round scanning algorithm is proposed. We successfully applied our algorithm to detect activities that are anomalous in different ways, achieving performance competitive to other state-of-the-art methods which requiring supervision.

    * Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-from-Motion not only enable the reconstruction of large scale scenes, but are also able to detect ambiguous structures caused by repeating elements that might result in incorrect reconstructions. Yet, it is not always possible to fully reconstruct a scene. The images required to merge different sub-models might be missing or it might be impossible to acquire such images in the first place due to occlusions or the structure of the scene. The problem of aligning multiple reconstructions that do not have visual overlap is impossible to solve in general. An important variant of this problem is the case in which individual sides of a building can be reconstructed but not joined due to the missing visual overlap. In this paper, we present a combinatorial approach for solving this variant by automatically stitching multiple sides of a building together. Our approach exploits symmetries and semantic information to reason about the possible geometric relations between the individual models. We show that our approach is able to reconstruct complete building models where traditional SfM ends up with disconnected building sides.

    * Abstract: There are many applications where multiple images are fused to form a single summary greyscale or colour output, including computational photography (e.g. RGB-NIR), diffusion tensor imaging (medical), and remote sensing. Often, and intuitively, image fusion is carried out in the derivative domain. Here, a new composite fused derivative is found that best accounts for the detail across all images and then the resulting gradient field is reintegrated. However, the reintegration step generally hallucinates new detail (not appearing in any of the input image bands) including halo and bending artifacts. In this paper we avoid these hallucinated details by avoiding the reintegration step. Our work builds directly on the work of Socolinsky and Wolff who derive their equivalent gradient field from the per-pixel Di Zenzo structure tensor which is defined as the inner product of the image Jacobian. We show that the x- and y- derivatives of the projection of the original image onto the Principal characteristic vector of the Outer Product (POP) of the Jacobian generates the same equivalent gradient field. In so doing, we have derived a fused image that has the derivative structure we seek. Of course, this projection will be meaningful only where the Jacobian has non-zero derivatives, so we diffuse the projection directions using a bilateral filter before we calculate the fused image. The resulting POP fused image has maximal fused detail but avoids hallucinated artifacts. Experiments demonstrate our method delivers state of the art image fusion performance.

    * Authors: Enliang Zheng, Changchang Wu
    * Abstract: This paper proposes a new incremental structure from motion (SfM) algorithm based on a novel structure-less camera resection technique. Traditional methods rely on 2D-3D correspondences to compute the pose of candidate cameras using PnP. In this work, we take the collection of already reconstructed cameras as a generalized camera, and determine the absolute pose of a candidate pinhole camera from pure 2D correspondences, which we call it semi-generalized camera pose problem. We present the minimal solvers of the new problem for both calibrated and partially calibrated (unknown focal length) pinhole cameras. By integrating these new algorithms in an incremental SfM system, we go beyond the state-of-art methods with the capability of reconstructing cameras without 2D-3D correspondences. Large-scale real image experiments show that our new SfM system significantly improves the completeness of 3D reconstruction over the standard approach.

    * Abstract: Many scenes that we would like to reconstruct contain articulated objects, and are often captured by only a single, non-fixed camera. Existing techniques for reconstructing articulated objects either require templates, which can be challenging to acquire, or have difficulties with perspective effects and missing data. In this paper, we present a novel reconstruction pipeline that first treats each feature point tracked on the object independently and incrementally imposes constraints. We make use of the idea that the unknown 3D trajectory of a point tracked in 2D should lie on a manifold that is described by the camera rays going through the tracked 2D positions. We compute an initial reconstruction by solving for latent 3D trajectories that maximize temporal smoothness on these manifolds. We then leverage these 3D estimates to automatically segment an object into piecewise rigid parts, and compute a refined shape and motion using sparse bundle adjustment. Finally, we apply kinematic constraints on automatically computed joint positions to enforce connectivity between different rigid parts, which further reduces ambiguous motion and increases reconstruction accuracy. Each step of our pipeline enforces temporal smoothness, and together results in a high quality articulated object reconstruction. We show the usefulness of our approach in both synthetic and real datasets and compare against other non-rigid reconstruction techniques.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of finding consistent matches across multiple images. Current state-of-the-art solutions use constraints on cycles of matches together with convex optimization, leading to computationally intensive iterative algorithms. In this paper, we instead propose a clustering-based formulation: we first rigorously show its equivalence with traditional approaches, and then propose QuickMatch, a novel algorithm that identifies multi-image matches from a density function in feature space. Specifically, QuickMatch uses the density estimate to order the points in a tree, and then extracts the matches by breaking this tree using feature distances and measures of distinctiveness. Our algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods (such as MatchALS) in accuracy, and it is significantly faster (up to 62 times faster on some benchmarks), and can scale to large datasets (with more than twenty thousands features).

The results of our extensive experiments show that the proposed solution achieves comparable performance, and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks--even though our solution only requires minimal post-processing to parse a bounding box from a detected text map, while others often require heavy post-processing.

    * Abstract: Moving Object Detection is one of the integral tasks for aerial reconnaissance and surveillance applications. Despite the problem's rising potential due to increasing availability of unmanned aerial vehicles, moving object detection suffers from a lack of widely-accepted, correctly labelled dataset that would facilitate a robust evaluation of the techniques published by the community. Towards this end, we compile a new dataset by manually annotating several sequences from VIVID and UAV123 datasets for moving object detection. We also propose a feature-based, efficient pipeline that is optimized for near real-time performance on GPU-based embedded SoMs (system on module). We evaluate our pipeline on this extended dataset for low altitude moving object detection. Ground-truth annotations are made publicly available to the community to foster further research in moving object detection field.

    * Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection aims at learning precise object detectors, given image category labels. In recent prevailing works, this problem is generally formulated as a multiple instance learning module guided by an image classification loss. The object bounding box is assumed to be the one contributing most to the classification among all proposals. However, the region contributing most is also likely to be a crucial part or the supporting context of an object. To obtain a more accurate detector, in this work we propose a novel end-to-end weakly supervised detection approach, where a newly introduced generative adversarial segmentation module interacts with the conventional detection module in a collaborative loop. The collaboration mechanism takes full advantages of the complementary interpretations of the weakly supervised localization task, namely detection and segmentation tasks, forming a more comprehensive solution. Consequently, our method obtains more precise object bounding boxes, rather than parts or irrelevant surroundings. Expectedly, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 53.7% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-arts and demonstrating its superiority for weakly supervised object detection.

    * Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have ushered in a revolution in image-to-image translation. The development and proliferation of GANs raises an interesting question: can we train a GAN to remove an object, if present, from an image while otherwise preserving the image? Specifically, can a GAN "virtually heal" anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health status (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions could be revealed by subtracting those two images? Such a task requires a GAN to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1) supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and (2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation, we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization using only image-level annotation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in multi-domain image-to-image translation and that it surpasses predominant weakly-supervised localization methods in both disease detection and localization. Implementation is available at https://github.com/jlianglab/Fixed-Point-GAN.

    * Authors: Josiah Wang,  Lucia Specia
    * Abstract: Localizing phrases in images is an important part of image understanding and can be useful in many applications that require mappings between textual and visual information. Existing work attempts to learn these mappings from examples of phrase-image region correspondences (strong supervision) or from phrase-image pairs (weak supervision). We postulate that such paired annotations are unnecessary, and propose the first method for the phrase localization problem where neither training procedure nor paired, task-specific data is required. Our method is simple but effective: we use off-the-shelf approaches to detect objects, scenes and colours in images, and explore different approaches to measure semantic similarity between the categories of detected visual elements and words in phrases. Experiments on two well-known phrase localization datasets show that this approach surpasses all weakly supervised methods by a large margin and performs very competitively to strongly supervised methods, and can thus be considered a strong baseline to the task. The non-paired nature of our method makes it applicable to any domain and where no paired phrase localization annotation is available.

    * Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) for the semantic segmentation of images are usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of object classes. This is in contrast to the ""open world"" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be deployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect so-called ""out-of-distribution"" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's semantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A natural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise softmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves that approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy and introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on these samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we re-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and consistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on completely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent post-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called ""meta classification"". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we consistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance, cutting down the number of detection errors by 52% when comparing the best baseline with our results. We achieve this improvement sacrificing only marginally in original segmentation performance. Therefore, our method contributes to safer DNNs with more reliable overall system performance.

    * Abstract: Brain midline shift (MLS), demonstrated by imaging, is a qualitative and quantitative radiological feature which measures the extent of lateral shift of brain midline structures in response to mass effect caused by hematomas, tumors, abscesses or any other space occupying intracranial lesions. It can be used, with other parameters, to determine the urgency of neurosurgical interventions and to predict clinical outcome in patients with space occupying lesions. However, precisely detecting and quantifying MLS can be challenging due to the great variability in clinically relevant brain structures across cases. In this study, we investigated a cascaded network pipeline consisting of case-level MLS detection and initial localization and refinement of brain landmark locations by using classification and segmentation network architectures. We used a 3D U-Net for initial localization and subsequently a 2D U-Net to estimate exact landmark points at finer resolution. In the refinement step, we fused the prediction from multiple slices to calculate the final location for each landmark. We trained these two U- Nets with the Gaussian heatmap targets generated from the brain's anatomical markers. The case-level ground-truth labels and landmark annotation were generated by multiple trained annotators and reviewed by radiology technologists and radiologists. Our proposed pipeline achieved the case- level MLS detection performance of 95.3% in AUC using a testing dataset from 2,545 head non-contrast computed tomography cases and quantify MLS with a mean absolute error of 1.20 mm on 228 MLS positive cases.

    * Abstract: We investigate ways to leverage uncertainty in face images to improve the quality of the face clusters. We observe that popular clustering algorithms do not produce better quality clusters when clustering probabilistic face representations that implicitly model uncertainty -- these algorithms predict up to 9.6X more clusters than the ground truth for the IJB-A benchmark. We empirically analyze the causes for this unexpected behavior and identify excessive false-positives and false-negatives (when comparing face-pairs) as the main reasons for poor quality clustering. Based on this insight, we propose an uncertainty-aware \clustering algorithm, UAC, which explicitly leverages uncertainty information during clustering to decide when a pair of faces are similar or when a predicted cluster should be discarded. UAC considers (a) uncertainty of faces in face-pairs, (b) bins face-pairs into different categories based on an uncertainty threshold, (c) intelligently varies the similarity threshold during clustering to reduce false-negatives and false-positives, and (d) discards predicted clusters that exhibit a high measure of uncertainty. Extensive experimental results on several popular benchmarks and comparisons with state-of-the-art clustering methods show that UAC produces significantly better clusters by leveraging uncertainty in face images -- predicted number of clusters is up to 0.18X more of the ground truth for the IJB-A benchmark.

    * Abstract: The distance transform of a binary image is a classic tool in computer vision and it has been widely used in the field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to study porous media. A common practice is to convert grayscale images to binary ones to apply the distance transform. In this work, by considering the threshold decomposition of a grayscale image, we prove that threshold decomposition and distance transform together to formulate a two-parameter filtration. This would offer the TDA community a concrete example to apply multi-parameter persistence on digital image analysis. We demonstrate our method on the firn dataset.

    * Abstract: Recent advancements in deep generative models have facilitated the creation of photo-realistic images across various tasks. However, these generated images often exhibit perceptual artifacts in specific regions, necessitating manual correction. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical examination of Perceptual Artifacts Localization (PAL) spanning diverse image synthesis endeavors. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,168 generated images, each annotated with per-pixel perceptual artifact labels across ten synthesis tasks. A segmentation model, trained on our proposed dataset, effectively localizes artifacts across a range of tasks. Additionally, we illustrate its proficiency in adapting to previously unseen models using minimal training samples. We further propose an innovative zoom-in inpainting pipeline that seamlessly rectifies perceptual artifacts in the generated images. Through our experimental analyses, we elucidate several invaluable downstream applications, such as automated artifact rectification, non-referential image quality evaluation, and abnormal region detection in images.

    * Abstract: Examination of chest X-ray images is currently one of the most important methods for the screening and diagnosis of thoracic diseases and, in some cases, for assessing response to treatment. However, this task is time-consuming and expensive as it requires a detailed visual inspection and interpretation by a trained clinician. In the past decade, several machine learning (ML) methods have been developed to remedy this issue as clinical decision support methods. However, most of these algorithms face challenges like computational feasibility, reliability, and interpretability. In this paper, we develop a unique feature extraction method for chest X-rays by applying the latest topological data analysis (TDA) methods. We observe that normal and abnormal images produce very distinct topological patterns for pneumonia and tuberculosis. By using cubical persistence, we capture these patterns and convert them into powerful feature vectors. By combining with standard ML methods, we obtain a computationally feasible and interpretable model. In our extensive experiments, our model Topo-CXR outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in several benchmark datasets. Unlike most DL models, our proposed Topo-CXR model does not need any data augmentation or pre-processing steps and works perfectly on small datasets. Furthermore, our topological feature vectors can be easily integrated with any future ML and DL models to boost their performance and improve robustness.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a learning approach for detecting nematocysts in Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. The image dataset was collected and made available to us by biologists for the purposes of morphological studies of corals, jellyfish, and other species in the phylum Cnidaria. Challenges for computer vision presented by this biological domain are rarely seen in general images of natural scenes. We formulate nematocyst detection as labeling of a regular grid of image patches. This structured prediction problem is specified within two frameworks: CRF and HC-Search. The CRF uses graph cuts for inference. The HC-Search approach is based on search in the space of outputs. It uses a learned heuristic function (H) to uncover high-quality candidate labelings of image patches, and then uses a learned cost function (C) to select the final prediction among the candidates. While locally optimal CRF inference may be sufficient for images of natural scenes, our results demonstrate that CRF with graph cuts performs poorly on the nematocyst images, and that HC-Search outperforms CRF with graph cuts. This suggests biological images of flexible objects present new challenges requiring further advances of, or alternatives to existing methods.

    * Abstract: Microplastics pollution has been recognized as a serious environmental concern, with serious research efforts underway to determine primary causes. Experiments typically generate bright-field images of microplastic fibers that are filtered from water. Environmental decision making in process engineering critically relies on accurate quantification of microplastic fibers in these images. To satisfy the required standards, images are often analyzed manually, resulting in a highly tedious process, with thousands of fiber instances per image. While the shape of individual fibers is relatively simple, it is difficult to separate them in highly crowded scenes with significant overlap. We propose a fiber instance detection pipeline, which decomposes the fiber detection and segmentation into manageable subproblems. Well separated instances are identified with robust image processing techniques, such as adaptive thresholding, and morphological skeleton analysis, while tangled fibers are separated by an algorithm based on deep pixel embeddings. Moreover, we present a modified Intersection-over- Union metric as a more appropriate similarity metric for elongated shapes. Our approach improves significantly on out-of-sample data, in particular for difficult cases of intersecting fibers.

    * Abstract: Machine vision for precision agriculture has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. The goal of this paper is to develop an end-end cranberry health monitoring system to enable and support real time cranberry over-heating assessment to facilitate informed decisions that may sustain the economic viability of the farm. Toward this goal, we propose two main deep learning-based modules for: 1) cranberry fruit segmentation to delineate the exact fruit regions in the cranberry field image that are exposed to sun, 2) prediction of cloud coverage conditions to estimate the inner temperature of exposed cranberries We develop drone-based field data and ground-based sky data collection systems to collect video imagery at multiple time points for use in crop health analysis. Extensive evaluation on the data set shows that it is possible to predict exposed fruit's inner temperature with high accuracy (0.02% MAPE) when irradiance is predicted with 5.59-19.84% MAPE in the 5-20 minutes time horizon. With 62.54% mIoU for segmentation and 13.46 MAE for counting accuracies in exposed fruit identification, this system is capable of giving informed feedback to growers to take precautionary action (e.g., irrigation) in identified crop field regions with higher risk of sunburn in the near future. Though this novel system is applied for cranberry health monitoring, it represents a pioneering step forward in efficiency for farming and is useful in precision agriculture beyond the problem of cranberry overheating.

    * Abstract: Marine vessel traffic is one of the main sources of negative anthropogenic impact upon marine environments. The automatic identification of boats in monitoring images facilitates conservation, research and patrolling efforts. However, the diverse sizes of vessels, the highly dynamic water surface and weather-related visibility issues significantly hinder this task. While recent deep learning (DL)-based object detectors identify well medium- and large-sized boats, smaller vessels, often responsible for substantial disturbance to sensitive marine life, are typically not detected. We propose a detection approach that combines state-of-the-art object detectors and a novel Detector of Small Marine Vessels (DSMV) to identify boats of any size. The DSMV uses a short time series of images and a novel bi-directional Gaussian Mixture technique to determine motion in combination with context-based filtering and a DL-based image classifier. Experimental results obtained on our publicly-released datasets of images containing boats of various sizes show that the proposed approach comfortably outperforms five popular state-of-the-art object detectors.

    * Abstract: Intra-camera supervision (ICS) for person re-identification (Re-ID) assumes that identity labels are independently annotated within each camera view and no inter-camera identity association is labeled. It is a new setting proposed recently to reduce the burden of annotation while expect to maintain desirable Re-ID performance. However, the lack of inter-camera labels makes the ICS Re-ID problem much more challenging than the fully supervised counterpart. By investigating the characteristics of ICS, this paper proposes jointly learned camera-specific non-parametric classifiers, together with a hybrid mining quintuplet loss, to perform intra-camera learning. Then, an inter-camera learning module consisting of a graph-based ID association step and a Re-ID model updating step is conducted. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Re-ID datasets show that our approach outperforms all existing ICS works by a great margin. Our approach performs even comparable to state-of-the-art fully supervised methods in two of the datasets.

    * Abstract: We present a novel approach for oriented object detection, named TricubeNet, which localizes oriented objects using visual cues (i.e., heatmap) instead of oriented box offsets regression. We represent each object as a 2D Tricube kernel and extract bounding boxes using simple image-processing algorithms. Our approach is able to (1) obtain well-arranged boxes from visual cues, (2) solve the angle discontinuity problem, and (3) can save computational complexity due to our anchor-free modeling. To further boost the performance, we propose some effective techniques for size-invariant loss, reducing false detections, extracting rotation-invariant features, and heatmap refinement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our TricubeNet, we experiment on various tasks for weakly-occluded oriented object detection: detection in an aerial image, densely packed object image, and text image. The extensive experimental results show that our TricubeNet is quite effective for oriented object detection. Code is available at https://github.com/qjadud1994/TricubeNet.

Specifically, we explore Masked Autoencoders (MAE) whose task is to reconstruct missing pixels from a small proportion of each image and figure out a strong recipe for pre-training MAE and fine-tuning on chest X-ray datasets, revealing that medical reconstruction needs a much smaller proportion of an image than natural images (10% vs. 25%) and a more moderate RandomResizedCrop cropping range than natural images (0.5 1.0 vs. 0.2 1.0). With our recipe, ViT-S shows competitive results with the state-of-the-art CNN model (DenseNet-121) on three public chest X-ray datasets and 2.5x faster pre-training on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset and CheXpert. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make vanilla ViT achieve state-of-the-art performance on chest X-ray datasets. We hope that this study can direct future research on the application of Transformers to a larger variety of medical imaging tasks. Code will be made available.

    * Abstract: Several recent deep learning (DL) based techniques perform considerably well on image-based multilingual text detection. However, their performance relies heavily on the availability and quality of training data. There are numerous types of page-level document images consisting of information in several modalities, languages, fonts, and layouts. This makes text detection a challenging problem in the field of computer vision (CV), especially for low-resource or handwritten languages. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of word-level labeled data for text detection, especially for multilingual settings and Indian scripts that incorporate both printed and handwritten text. Conventionally, Indian script text detection requires training a DL model on plenty of labeled data, but to the best of our knowledge, no relevant datasets are available. Manual annotation of such data requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise. In order to solve this problem, we propose TEXTRON, a Data Programming-based approach, where users can plug various text detection methods into a weak supervision-based learning framework. One can view this approach to multilingual text detection as an ensemble of different CV-based techniques and DL approaches. TEXTRON can leverage the predictions of DL models pre-trained on a significant amount of language data in conjunction with CV-based methods to improve text detection in other languages. We demonstrate that TEXTRON can improve the detection performance for documents written in Indian languages, despite the absence of corresponding labeled data. Further, through extensive experimentation, we show improvement brought about by our approach over the current State-of-the-art (SOTA) models, especially for handwritten Devanagari text.

    * Abstract: Recently, the first foundation model developed specifically for image segmentation tasks was developed, termed the "Segment Anything Model" (SAM). SAM can segment objects in input imagery based on cheap input prompts, such as one (or more) points, a bounding box, or a mask. The authors examined the zero-shot image segmentation accuracy of SAM on a large number of vision benchmark tasks and found that SAM usually achieved recognition accuracy similar to, or sometimes exceeding, vision models that had been trained on the target tasks. The impressive generalization of SAM for segmentation has major implications for vision researchers working on natural imagery. In this work, we examine whether SAM's performance extends to overhead imagery problems and help guide the community's response to its development. We examine SAM's performance on a set of diverse and widely studied benchmark tasks. We find that SAM does often generalize well to overhead imagery, although it fails in some cases due to the unique characteristics of overhead imagery and its common target objects. We report on these unique systematic failure cases for remote sensing imagery that may comprise useful future research for the community.

    * Abstract: Stochastic block models characterize observed network relationships via latent community memberships. In large social networks, we expect entities to participate in multiple communities, and the number of communities to grow with the network size. We introduce a new model for these phenomena, the hierarchical Dirichlet process relational model, which allows nodes to have mixed membership in an unbounded set of communities. To allow scalable learning, we derive an online stochastic variational inference algorithm. Focusing on assortative models of undirected networks, we also propose an efficient structured mean field variational bound, and online methods for automatically pruning unused communities. Compared to state-of-the-art online learning methods for parametric relational models, we show significantly improved perplexity and link prediction accuracy for sparse networks with tens of thousands of nodes. We also showcase an analysis of LittleSis, a large network of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government.

    * Authors: Yifei Ma, Roman Garnett, Jeff Schneider
    * Abstract: A common classifier for unlabeled nodes on undirected graphs uses label propagation from the labeled nodes, equivalent to the harmonic predictor on Gaussian random fields (GRFs). For active learning on GRFs, the commonly used V-optimality criterion queries nodes that reduce the L2 (regression) loss. V-optimality satisfies a submodularity property showing that greedy reduction produces a (1 − 1/e) globally optimal solution. However, L2 loss may not characterise the true nature of 0/1 loss in classification problems and thus may not be the best choice for active learning. We consider a new criterion we call Σ-optimality, which queries the node that minimizes the sum of the elements in the predictive covariance. Σ-optimality directly optimizes the risk of the surveying problem, which is to determine the proportion of nodes belonging to one class. In this paper we extend submodularity guarantees from V-optimality to Σ-optimality using properties specific to GRFs. We further show that GRFs satisfy the suppressor-free condition in addition to the conditional independence inherited from Markov random fields. We test Σ-optimality on real-world graphs with both synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms V-optimality and other related methods on classification.

    * Abstract: While robust parameter estimation has been well studied in parametric density estimation, there has been little investigation into robust density estimation in the nonparametric setting. We present a robust version of the popular kernel density estimator (KDE). As with other estimators, a robust version of the KDE is useful since sample contamination is a common issue with datasets. What ``robustness'' means for a nonparametric density estimate is not straightforward and is a topic we explore in this paper. To construct a robust KDE we scale the traditional KDE and project it to its nearest weighted KDE in the $L^2$ norm. Because the squared $L^2$ norm penalizes point-wise errors superlinearly this causes the weighted KDE to allocate more weight to high density regions. We demonstrate the robustness of the SPKDE with numerical experiments and a consistency result which shows that asymptotically the SPKDE recovers the uncontaminated density under sufficient conditions on the contamination.

    * Authors: Somdeb Sarkhel, Deepak Venugopal, Parag Singla, Vibhav G. Gogate
    * Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach for lifted MAP inference in Markov logic networks (MLNs). The key idea in our approach is to compactly encode the MAP inference problem as an Integer Polynomial Program (IPP) by schematically applying three lifted inference steps to the MLN: lifted decomposition, lifted conditioning, and partial grounding. Our IPP encoding is lifted in the sense that an integer assignment to a variable in the IPP may represent a truth-assignment to multiple indistinguishable ground atoms in the MLN. We show how to solve the IPP by first converting it to an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and then solving the latter using state-of-the-art ILP techniques. Experiments on several benchmark MLNs show that our new algorithm is substantially superior to ground inference and existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality.

    * Authors: Calvin McCarter, Seyoung Kim
    * Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of learning the structure of Gaussian chain graph models in a high-dimensional space. Chain graph models are generalizations of undirected and directed graphical models that contain a mixed set of directed and undirected edges. While the problem of sparse structure learning has been studied extensively for Gaussian graphical models and more recently for conditional Gaussian graphical models (CGGMs), there has been little previous work on the structure recovery of Gaussian chain graph models. We consider linear regression models and a re-parameterization of the linear regression models using CGGMs as building blocks of chain graph models. We argue that when the goal is to recover model structures, there are many advantages of using CGGMs as chain component models over linear regression models, including convexity of the optimization problem, computational efficiency, recovery of structured sparsity, and ability to leverage the model structure for semi-supervised learning. We demonstrate our approach on simulated and genomic datasets.

    * Abstract: This paper studies the problem of rank aggregation under the Plackett-Luce model. The goal is to infer a global ranking and related scores of the items, based on partial rankings provided by multiple users over multiple subsets of items. A question of particular interest is how to optimally assign items to users for ranking and how many item assignments are needed to achieve a target estimation error. Without any assumptions on how the items are assigned to users, we derive an oracle lower bound and the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound of the estimation error. We prove an upper bound on the estimation error achieved by the maximum likelihood estimator, and show that both the upper bound and the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound inversely depend on the spectral gap of the Laplacian of an appropriately defined comparison graph. Since random comparison graphs are known to have large spectral gaps, this suggests the use of random assignments when we have the control. Precisely, the matching oracle lower bound and the upper bound on the estimation error imply that the maximum likelihood estimator together with a random assignment is minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor. We further analyze a popular rank-breaking scheme that decompose partial rankings into pairwise comparisons. We show that even if one applies the mismatched maximum likelihood estimator that assumes independence (on pairwise comparisons that are now dependent due to rank-breaking), minimax optimal performance is still achieved up to a logarithmic factor.

    * Abstract: Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying network topology, but it also has the power to change it. Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics.We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic data and data gathered from Twitter, and show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.

    * Abstract: Large unweighted directed graphs are commonly used to capture relations between entities. A fundamental problem in the analysis of such networks is to properly define the similarity or dissimilarity between any two vertices. Despite the significance of this problem, statistical characterization of the proposed metrics has been limited.We introduce and develop a class of techniques for analyzing random walks on graphs using stochastic calculus. Using these techniques we generalize results on the degeneracy of hitting times and analyze a metric based on the Laplace transformed hitting time (LTHT). The metric serves as a natural, provably well-behaved alternative to the expected hitting time. We establish a general correspondence between hitting times of the Brownian motion and analogous hitting times on the graph. We show that the LTHT is consistent with respect to the underlying metric of a geometric graph, preserves clustering tendency, and remains robust against random addition of non-geometric edges. Tests on simulated and real-world data show that the LTHT matches theoretical predictions and outperforms alternatives.

    * Abstract: Bayesian networks are a popular representation of asymmetric (for example causal) relationships between random variables. Markov random fields (MRFs) are a complementary model of symmetric relationships used in computer vision, spatial modeling, and social and gene expression networks. A chain graph model under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg interpretation (hereafter a chain graph model) generalizes both Bayesian networks and MRFs, and can represent asymmetric and symmetric relationships together.As in other graphical models, the set of marginals from distributions in a chain graph model induced by the presence of hidden variables forms a complex model. One recent approach to the study of marginal graphical models is to consider a well-behaved supermodel. Such a supermodel of marginals of Bayesian networks, defined only by conditional independences, and termed the ordinary Markov model, was studied at length in (Evans and Richardson, 2014).In this paper, we show that special mixed graphs which we call segregated graphs can be associated, via a Markov property, with supermodels of a marginal of chain graphs defined only by conditional independences. Special features of segregated graphs imply the existence of a very natural factorization for these supermodels, and imply many existing results on the chain graph model, and ordinary Markov model carry over. Our results suggest that segregated graphs define an analogue of the ordinary Markov model for marginals of chain graph models.

    * Abstract: Reconstruction of neuroanatomy is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Stochastic expression of colors in individual cells is a promising tool, although its use in the nervous system has been limited due to various sources of variability in expression. Moreover, the intermingled anatomy of neuronal trees is challenging for existing segmentation algorithms. Here, we propose a method to automate the segmentation of neurons in such (potentially pseudo-colored) images. The method uses spatio-color relations between the voxels, generates supervoxels to reduce the problem size by four orders of magnitude before the final segmentation, and is parallelizable over the supervoxels. To quantify performance and gain insight, we generate simulated images, where the noise level and characteristics, the density of expression, and the number of fluorophore types are variable. We also present segmentations of real Brainbow images of the mouse hippocampus, which reveal many of the dendritic segments.

    * Abstract: Can we incorporate discrete optimization algorithms within modern machine learning models? For example, is it possible to use in deep architectures a layer whose output is the minimal cut of a parametrized graph? Given that these models are trained end-to-end by leveraging gradient information, the introduction of such layers seems very challenging due to their non-continuous output. In this paper we focus on the problem of submodular minimization, for which we show that such layers are indeed possible. The key idea is that we can continuously relax the output without sacrificing guarantees. We provide an easily computable approximation to the Jacobian complemented with a complete theoretical analysis. Finally, these contributions let us experimentally learn probabilistic log-supermodular models via a bi-level variational inference formulation.

The simple closed-form screening rule is a necessary and sufficient condition for exactly recovering the blockwise structure of a solution under any given regularization parameters. With enough sparsity, the screening rule can be combined with various optimization procedures to deliver solutions efficiently in practice. The screening rule is especially suitable for large-scale exploratory data analysis, where the number of variables in the dataset can be thousands while we are only interested in the relationship among a handful of variables within moderate-size clusters for interpretability. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the efficiency and insights gained from the introduction of the screening rule.

    * Abstract: The prediction of organic reaction outcomes is a fundamental problem in computational chemistry. Since a reaction may involve hundreds of atoms, fully exploring the space of possible transformations is intractable. The current solution utilizes reaction templates to limit the space, but it suffers from coverage and efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a template-free approach to efficiently explore the space of product molecules by first pinpointing the reaction center -- the set of nodes and edges where graph edits occur. Since only a small number of atoms contribute to reaction center, we can directly enumerate candidate products. The generated candidates are scored by a Weisfeiler-Lehman Difference Network that models high-order interactions between changes occurring at nodes across the molecule. Our framework outperforms the top-performing template-based approach with a 10% margin, while running orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we demonstrate that the model accuracy rivals the performance of domain experts.

    * Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous data structures for representing interactions between entities. With an emphasis on applications in chemistry, we explore the task of learning to generate graphs that conform to a distribution observed in training data. We propose a variational autoencoder model in which both encoder and decoder are graph-structured. Our decoder assumes a sequential ordering of graph extension steps and we discuss and analyze design choices that mitigate the potential downsides of this linearization. Experiments compare our approach with a wide range of baselines on the molecule generation task and show that our method is successful at matching the statistics of the original dataset on semantically important metrics. Furthermore, we show that by using appropriate shaping of the latent space, our model allows us to design molecules that are (locally) optimal in desired properties.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we model the dependencies among the items that are recommended to a user in a collaborative-filtering problem via a Gaussian Markov Random Field (MRF). We build upon Besag's auto-normal parameterization and pseudo-likelihood, which not only enables computationally efficient learning, but also connects the areas of MRFs and sparse inverse covariance estimation with autoencoders and neighborhood models, two successful approaches in collaborative filtering. We propose a novel approximation for learning sparse MRFs, where the trade-off between recommendation-accuracy and training-time can be controlled. At only a small fraction of the training-time compared to various baselines, including deep nonlinear models, the proposed approach achieved competitive ranking-accuracy on all three well-known data-sets used in our experiments, and notably a 20% gain in accuracy on the data-set with the largest number of items.

    * Authors: Sandeep Kumar, Jiaxi Ying, Jose Vinicius de Miranda Cardoso, Daniel Palomar
    * Abstract: Learning a graph with a specific structure is essential for interpretability and identification of the relationships among data. But structured graph learning from observed samples is an NP-hard combinatorial problem. In this paper, we first show, for a set of important graph families it is possible to convert the combinatorial constraints of structure into eigenvalue constraints of the graph Laplacian matrix. Then we introduce a unified graph learning framework lying at the integration of the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix with Gaussian graphical modeling, which is capable of learning structures of a large class of graph families. The proposed algorithms are provably convergent and practically amenable for big-data specific tasks. Extensive numerical experiments with both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. An R package containing codes for all the experimental results is submitted as a supplementary file.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the trajectories of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the aim of understanding their convergence properties in non-convex problems. We first show that the sequence of iterates generated by SGD remains bounded and converges with probability $1$ under a very broad range of step-size schedules. Subsequently, we prove that the algorithm's rate of convergence to local minimizers with a positive-definite Hessian is $O(1/n^p)$ if the method is run with a $Θ(1/n^p)$ step-size. This provides an important guideline for tuning the algorithm's step-size as it suggests that a cool-down phase with a vanishing step-size could lead to significant performance gains; we demonstrate this heuristic using ResNet architectures on CIFAR. Finally, going beyond existing positive probability guarantees, we show that SGD avoids strict saddle points/manifolds with probability $1$ for the entire spectrum of step-size policies considered.

    * Abstract: Normalizing flows and variational autoencoders are powerful generative models that can represent complicated density functions. However, they both impose constraints on the models: Normalizing flows use bijective transformations to model densities whereas VAEs learn stochastic transformations that are non-invertible and thus typically do not provide tractable estimates of the marginal likelihood. In this paper, we introduce SurVAE Flows: A modular framework of composable transformations that encompasses VAEs and normalizing flows. SurVAE Flows bridge the gap between normalizing flows and VAEs with surjective transformations, wherein the transformations are deterministic in one direction -- thereby allowing exact likelihood computation, and stochastic in the reverse direction -- hence providing a lower bound on the corresponding likelihood. We show that several recently proposed methods, including dequantization and augmented normalizing flows, can be expressed as SurVAE Flows. Finally, we introduce common operations such as the max value, the absolute value, sorting and stochastic permutation as composable layers in SurVAE Flows.

    * Abstract: A growing body of work has begun to study intervention design for efficient structure learning of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A typical setting is a \emph{causally sufficient} setting, i.e. a system with no latent confounders, selection bias, or feedback, when the essential graph of the observational equivalence class (EC) is given as an input and interventions are assumed to be noiseless. Most existing works focus on \textit{worst-case} or \textit{average-case} lower bounds for the number of interventions required to orient a DAG. These worst-case lower bounds only establish that the largest clique in the essential graph \textit{could} make it difficult to learn the true DAG. In this work, we develop a \textit{universal} lower bound for single-node interventions that establishes that the largest clique is \textit{always} a fundamental impediment to structure learning. Specifically, we present a decomposition of a DAG into independently orientable components through \emph{directed clique trees} and use it to prove that the number of single-node interventions necessary to orient any DAG in an EC is at least the sum of half the size of the largest cliques in each chain component of the essential graph. Moreover, we present a two-phase intervention design algorithm that, under certain conditions on the chordal skeleton, matches the optimal number of interventions up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor in the number of maximal cliques. We show via synthetic experiments that our algorithm can scale to much larger graphs than most of the related work and achieves better worst-case performance than other scalable approaches.

    * Abstract: Hypergraphs are important objects to model ternary or higher-order relations of objects, and have a number of applications in analysing many complex datasets occurring in practice. In this work we study a new heat diffusion process in hypergraphs, and employ this process to design a polynomial-time algorithm that approximately finds bipartite components in a hypergraph. We theoretically prove the performance of our proposed algorithm, and compare it against the previous state-of-the-art through extensive experimental analysis on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We find that our new algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art across a wide range of hypergraphs.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we consider a different data format for images: vector graphics. In contrast to raster graphics which are widely used in image recognition, vector graphics can be scaled up or down into any resolution without aliasing or information loss, due to the analytic representation of the primitives in the document. Furthermore, vector graphics are able to give extra structural information on how low-level elements group together to form high level shapes or structures. These merits of graphic vectors have not been fully leveraged in existing methods. To explore this data format, we target on the fundamental recognition tasks: object localization and classification. We propose an efficient CNN-free pipeline that does not render the graphic into pixels (i.e. rasterization), and takes textual document of the vector graphics as input, called YOLaT (You Only Look at Text). YOLaT builds multi-graphs to model the structural and spatial information in vector graphics, and a dual-stream graph neural network is proposed to detect objects from the graph. Our experiments show that by directly operating on vector graphics, YOLaT outperforms raster-graphic based object detection baselines in terms of both average precision and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/YOLaT-VectorGraphicsRecognition.

    * Authors: Hugues Van Assel, Thibault Espinasse, Julien Chiquet, Franck Picard
    * Abstract: Most popular dimension reduction (DR) methods like t-SNE and UMAP are based on minimizing a cost between input and latent pairwise similarities. Though widely used, these approaches lack clear probabilistic foundations to enable a full understanding of their properties and limitations. To that extent, we introduce a unifying statistical framework based on the coupling of hidden graphs using cross entropy. These graphs induce a Markov random field dependency structure among the observations in both input and latent spaces. We show that existing pairwise similarity DR methods can be retrieved from our framework with particular choices of priors for the graphs. Moreover this reveals that these methods relying on shift-invariant kernels suffer from a statistical degeneracy that explains poor performances in conserving coarse-grain dependencies. New links are drawn with PCA which appears as a non-degenerate graph coupling model.

    * Abstract: A fundamental procedure in the analysis of massive datasets is the construction of similarity graphs. Such graphs play a key role for many downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, graph learning, and nearest neighbor search. For these tasks, it is critical to build graphs which are sparse yet still representative of the underlying data. The benefits of sparsity are twofold: firstly, constructing dense graphs is infeasible in practice for large datasets, and secondly, the runtime of downstream tasks is directly influenced by the sparsity of the similarity graph. In this work, we present Stars: a highly scalable method for building extremely sparse graphs via two-hop spanners, which are graphs where similar points are connected by a path of length at most two. Stars can construct two-hop spanners with significantly fewer similarity comparisons, which are a major bottleneck for learning based models where comparisons are expensive to evaluate. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Stars builds a graph in nearly-linear time, where approximate nearest neighbors are contained within two-hop neighborhoods. In practice, we have deployed Stars for multiple data sets allowing for graph building at the Tera-Scale, i.e., for graphs with hundreds of billions of nodes and tens of trillions of edges. We evaluate the performance of Stars for clustering and graph learning, and demonstrate 10~1000-fold improvements in pairwise similarity comparisons and significant running time speedups with negligible quality loss.

    * Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) delivers invaluable and complementary information on the intrinsic properties of data inaccessible to conventional methods. However, high computational costs remain the primary roadblock hindering the successful application of TDA in real-world studies, particularly with machine learning on large complex networks.Indeed, most modern networks such as citation, blockchain, and online social networks often have hundreds of thousands of vertices, making the application of existing TDA methods infeasible. We develop two new, remarkably simple but effective algorithms to compute the exact persistence diagrams of large graphs to address this major TDA limitation. First, we prove that $(k+1)$-core of a graph $G$ suffices to compute its $k^{th}$ persistence diagram, $PD_k(G)$. Second, we introduce a pruning algorithm for graphs to compute their persistence diagrams by removing the dominated vertices. Our experiments on large networks show that our novel approach can achieve computational gains up to 95%. The developed framework provides the first bridge between the graph theory and TDA, with applications in machine learning of large complex networks.

    * Authors: Gerard Ben Arous, Reza Gheissari, Aukosh Jagannath
    * Abstract: We study the scaling limits of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with constant step-size in the high-dimensional regime. We prove limit theorems for the trajectories of summary statistics (i.e., finite-dimensional functions) of SGD as the dimension goes to infinity. Our approach allows one to choose the summary statistics that are tracked, the initialization, and the step-size. It yields both ballistic (ODE) and diffusive (SDE) limits, with the limit depending dramatically on the former choices. We find a critical scaling regime for the step-size below which this ``effective dynamics" matches gradient flow for the population loss, but at which, a new correction term appears which changes the phase diagram. About the fixed points of this effective dynamics, the corresponding diffusive limits can be quite complex and even degenerate. We demonstrate our approach on popular examples including estimation for spiked matrix and tensor models and classification via two-layer networks for binary and XOR-type Gaussian mixture models. These examples exhibit surprising phenomena including multimodal timescales to convergence as well as convergence to sub-optimal solutions with probability bounded away from zero from random (e.g., Gaussian) initializations.

    * Abstract: We introduce MOVE, a novel method to segment objects without any form of supervision. MOVE exploits the fact that foreground objects can be shifted locally relative to their initial position and result in realistic (undistorted) new images. This property allows us to train a segmentation model on a dataset of images without annotation and to achieve state of the art (SotA) performance on several evaluation datasets for unsupervised salient object detection and segmentation. In unsupervised single object discovery, MOVE gives an average CorLoc improvement of 7.2% over the SotA, and in unsupervised class-agnostic object detection it gives a relative AP improvement of 53% on average. Our approach is built on top of self-supervised features (e.g. from DINO or MAE), an inpainting network (based on the Masked AutoEncoder) and adversarial training.

    * Authors: Jennifer Brennan, Vahab Mirrokni, Jean Pouget-Abadie
    * Abstract: The conclusions of randomized controlled trials may be biased when the outcome of one unit depends on the treatment status of other units, a problem known as \textit{interference}. In this work, we study interference in the setting of one-sided bipartite experiments in which the experimental units---where treatments are randomized and outcomes are measured---do not interact directly. Instead, their interactions are mediated through their connections to \textit{interference units} on the other side of the graph. Examples of this type of interference are common in marketplaces and two-sided platforms. The \textit{cluster-randomized design} is a popular method to mitigate interference when the graph is known, but it has not been well-studied in the one-sided bipartite experiment setting. In this work, we formalize a natural model for interference in one-sided bipartite experiments using the exposure mapping framework. We first exhibit settings under which existing cluster-randomized designs fail to properly mitigate interference under this model. We then show that minimizing the bias of the difference-in-means estimator under our model results in a balanced partitioning clustering objective with a natural interpretation. We further prove that our design is minimax optimal over the class of linear potential outcomes models with bounded interference. We conclude by providing theoretical and experimental evidence of the robustness of our design to a variety of interference graphs and potential outcomes models.

    * Abstract: Internal measures that are used to assess the quality of a clustering usually take into account intra-group and/or inter-group criteria.There are many papers in the literature that propose algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for optimizing the former. However, the optimization of inter-group criteria is much less understood.Here, we contribute to the state-of-the-art of this literature by devising algorithms with provable guarantees for the maximization of two natural inter-group criteria, namely the minimum spacing and the minimum spanning tree spacing. The former is the minimum distance between points in different groups while the latter captures separability through the cost of the minimum spanning tree that connects all groups. We obtain results for both the unrestricted case, in which no constraint on the clusters is imposed, and for the constrained case where each group is required to have a minimum number of points. Our constraint is motivated by the fact that the popular Single-Linkage, which optimizes both criteria in the unrestricted case, produces clustering with many tiny groups.To complement our work, we present an empirical study with 10 real datasets that provides evidence that our methods work very well in practical settings.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel framework for analyzing the dynamics of distribution shift in real-world systems that captures the feedback loop between learning algorithms and the distributions on which they are deployed. Prior work largely models feedback-induced distribution shift as adversarial or via an overly simplistic distribution-shift structure. In contrast, we propose a coupled partial differential equation model that captures fine-grained changes in the distribution over time by accounting for complex dynamics that arise due to strategic responses to algorithmic decision-making, non-local endogenous population interactions, and other exogenous sources of distribution shift. We consider two common settings in machine learning: cooperative settings with information asymmetries, and competitive settings where a learner faces strategic users. For both of these settings, when the algorithm retrains via gradient descent, we prove asymptotic convergence of the retraining procedure to a steady-state, both in finite and in infinite dimensions, obtaining explicit rates in terms of the model parameters. To do so we derive new results on the convergence of coupled PDEs that extends what is known on multi-species systems. Empirically, we show that our approach captures well-documented forms of distribution shifts like polarization and disparate impacts that simpler models cannot capture.

    * Abstract: Pre-training on graph neural networks (GNNs) aims to learn transferable knowledge for downstream tasks with unlabeled data, and it has recently become an active research area. The success of graph pre-training models is often attributed to the massive amount of input data. In this paper, however, we identify the curse of big data phenomenon in graph pre-training: more training data do not necessarily lead to better downstream performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a better-with-less framework for graph pre-training: fewer, but carefully chosen data are fed into a GNN model to enhance pre-training. The proposed pre-training pipeline is called the data-active graph pre-training (APT) framework, and is composed of a graph selector and a pre-training model. The graph selector chooses the most representative and instructive data points based on the inherent properties of graphs as well as predictive uncertainty. The proposed predictive uncertainty, as feedback from the pre-training model, measures the confidence level of the model in the data. When fed with the chosen data, on the other hand, the pre-training model grasps an initial understanding of the new, unseen data, and at the same time attempts to remember the knowledge learned from previous data. Therefore, the integration and interaction between these two components form a unified framework (APT), in which graph pre-training is performed in a progressive and iterative way. Experiment results show that the proposed APT is able to obtain an efficient pre-training model with fewer training data and better downstream performance.

    * Abstract: Due to the high complexity of medical images and the scarcity of trained personnel, most large-scale radiological datasets are lacking fine-grained annotations and are often only described on image-level. These shortcomings hinder the deployment of automated diagnosis systems, which require human-interpretable justification for their decision process. In this paper, we address the problem of weakly supervised identification and localization of abnormalities in chest radiographs in a multiple-instance learning setting. To that end, we introduce a novel loss function for training convolutional neural networks increasing the localization confidence and assisting the overall disease identification. The loss leverages both image- and patch-level predictions to generate auxiliary supervision and enables specific training at patch-level. Rather than forming strictly binary from the predictions as done in previous loss formulations, we create targets in a more customized manner.This way, the loss accounts for possible misclassification of less certain instances. We show that the supervision provided within the proposed learning scheme leads to better performance and more precise predictions on prevalent datasets for multiple-instance learning as well as on the NIH ChestX-Ray14 benchmark for disease recognition than previously used losses.

    * Abstract: In recent years, cross-modal hashing has attracted an increasing attention due to its fast retrieval speed and low storage requirements. However, labeled datasets are limited in real application, and existing unsupervised cross-modal hashing algorithms usually employ heuristic geometric prior as semantics, which introduces serious deviations as the similarity score from original features cannot reasonably represent the relationships among instances. In this paper, we study the unsupervised deep cross-modal hash retrieval method and propose a novel Semantic Graph Evolutionary Hashing (SGEH) to solve the above problem. The key novelty of SGEH is its evolutionary affinity graph construction method. To be concrete, we explore the sparse similarity graph with clustering results, which evolve from fusing the affinity information from code-driven graph on intrinsic data and subsequently extends to dense hybrid semantic graph which restricts the process of hash code learning to learn more discriminative results. Moreover, the batch-inputs are chosen from edge set rather than vertexes for better exploring the original spatial information in the sparse graph. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal retrieval methods.

    * Abstract: In this paper we are interested in how semantic segmentation can help object detection. Towards this goal, we propose a novel deformable part-based model which exploits region-based segmentation algorithms that compute candidate object regions by bottom-up clustering followed by ranking of those regions. Our approach allows every detection hypothesis to select a segment (including void), and scores each box in the image using both the traditional HOG filters as well as a set of novel segmentation features. Thus our model "blends" between the detector and segmentation models. Since our features can be computed very efficiently given the segments, we maintain the same complexity as the original DPM [14]. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in PASCAL VOC 2010, and show that when employing only a root filter our approach outperforms Dalal & Triggs detector [12] on all classes, achieving 13% higher average AP. When employing the parts, we outperform the original DPM [14] in 19 out of 20 classes, achieving an improvement of 8% AP. Furthermore, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art on VOC'10 test by 4%.

    * Abstract: Color description is a challenging task because of large variations in RGB values which occur due to scene accidental events, such as shadows, shading, specularities, illuminant color changes, and changes in viewing geometry. Traditionally, this challenge has been addressed by capturing the variations in physics-based models, and deriving invariants for the undesired variations. The drawback of this approach is that sets of distinguishable colors in the original color space are mapped to the same value in the photometric invariant space. This results in a drop of discriminative power of the color description. In this paper we take an information theoretic approach to color description. We cluster color values together based on their discriminative power in a classification problem. The clustering has the explicit objective to minimize the drop of mutual information of the final representation. We show that such a color description automatically learns a certain degree of photometric invariance. We also show that a universal color representation, which is based on other data sets than the one at hand, can obtain competing performance. Experiments show that the proposed descriptor outperforms existing photometric invariants. Furthermore, we show that combined with shape description these color descriptors obtain excellent results on four challenging datasets, namely, PASCAL VOC 2007, Flowers-102, Stanford dogs-120 and Birds-200.

    * Abstract: Colorization refers to the process of adding color to black & white images or videos. This paper extends the term to handle surfaces in three dimensions. This is important for applications in which the colors of an object need to be restored and no relevant image exists for texturing it. We focus on surfaces with patterns and propose a novel algorithm for adding colors to these surfaces. The user needs only to scribble a few color strokes on one instance of each pattern, and the system proceeds to automatically colorize the whole surface. For this scheme to work, we address not only the problem of colorization, but also the problem of pattern detection on surfaces.

    * Abstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquer this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric, so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on the Ricci flow method and the method is general and robust. We apply our algorithm to study constrained human brain surface registration problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic, and achieve relative high performance when evaluated with some popular cortical surface registration evaluation standards.

    * Abstract: We study the problem of interactive segmentation and contour completion for multiple objects. The form of constraints our model incorporates are those coming from user scribbles (interior or exterior constraints) as well as information regarding the topology of the 2-D space after partitioning (number of closed contours desired). We discuss how concepts from discrete calculus and a simple identity using the Euler characteristic of a planar graph can be utilized to derive a practical algorithm for this problem. We also present specialized branch and bound methods for the case of single contour completion under such constraints. On an extensive dataset of ~ 1000 images, our experiments suggest that a small amount of side knowledge can give strong improvements over fully unsupervised contour completion methods. We show that by interpreting user indications topologically, user effort is substantially reduced.

    * Abstract: Collective motions are common in crowd systems and have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of multidisciplinary fields. Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor 1 .

    * Abstract: The subspace segmentation problem is addressed in this paper by effectively constructing an exactly block-diagonal sample affinity matrix. The block-diagonal structure is heavily desired for accurate sample clustering but is rather difficult to obtain. Most current state-of-the-art subspace segmentation methods (such as SSC and LRR) resort to alternative structural priors (such as sparseness and low-rankness) to construct the affinity matrix. In this work, we directly pursue the block-diagonal structure by proposing a graph Laplacian constraint based formulation, and then develop an efficient stochastic subgradient algorithm for optimization. Moreover, two new subspace segmentation methods, the block-diagonal SSC and LRR, are devised in this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research attempt to explicitly pursue such a block-diagonal structure. Extensive experiments on face clustering, motion segmentation and graph construction for semi-supervised learning clearly demonstrate the superiority of our novelly proposed subspace segmentation methods.

    * Abstract: A novel visual tracking algorithm using patch-based appearance models is proposed in this paper. We first divide the bounding box of a target object into multiple patches and then select only pertinent patches, which occur repeatedly near the center of the bounding box, to construct the foreground appearance model. We also divide the input image into non-overlapping blocks, construct a background model at each block location, and integrate these background models for tracking. Using the appearance models, we obtain an accurate foreground probability map. Finally, we estimate the optimal object position by maximizing the likelihood, which is obtained by convolving the foreground probability map with the pertinence mask. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art tracking algorithms significantly in terms of center position errors and success rates.

    * Abstract: Retinal images contain forests of mutually intersecting and overlapping venous and arterial vascular trees. The geometry of these trees shows adaptation to vascular diseases including diabetes, stroke and hypertension. Segmentation of the retinal vascular network is complicated by inconsistent vessel contrast, fuzzy edges, variable image quality, media opacities, complex intersections and overlaps. This paper presents a Bayesian approach to resolving the configuration of vascular junctions to correctly construct the vascular trees. A probabilistic model of vascular joints (terminals, bridges and bifurcations) and their configuration in junctions is built, and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation used to select most likely configurations. The model is built using a reference set of 3010 joints extracted from the DRIVE public domain vascular segmentation dataset, and evaluated on 3435 joints from the DRIVE test set, demonstrating an accuracy of 95.2%.

    * Authors: Sheng Chen, Alan Fern, Sinisa Todorovic
    * Abstract: This paper formulates and presents a solution to a new problem called person count localization. Given a video of a crowded scene, our goal is to output for each frame a set of: 1) Detections optimally covering both isolated individuals and cluttered groups of people; and 2) Counts of people inside these detections. This problem is a middle-ground between frame-level person counting, which does not localize counts, and person detection aimed at perfectly localizing people with count-one detections. Our problem formulation is important for a wide range of domains, where people appear frequently under severe occlusion within a crowd. As these crowds are often visually distinct from the rest of the scene, they can be viewed as ``visual phrases'' whose spatially tight localization and count assignment could facilitate higher-level video understanding. For count localization, we specify a novel framework of iterative error-driven revisions of a flow graph derived from noisy input of people detections and foreground segmentation. Each iteration creates and solves an integer program for count localization based on iterative revisions of the flow graph. The graph revisions are based on detected violations of basic integrity constraints. They in turn trigger learned modifications to the graph aimed at reducing noise in input features. For evaluation, we introduce a new metric that measures both count precision and localization of our approach on American football and pedestrian videos.

    * Abstract: Many design tasks involve the creation of new objects in the context of an existing scene. Existing work in computer vision only provides partial support for such tasks. On the one hand, multi-view stereo algorithms allow the reconstruction of real-world scenes, while on the other hand algorithms for line-drawing interpretation do not take context into account. Our work combines the strength of these two domains to interpret line drawings of imaginary objects drawn over photographs of an existing scene. The main challenge we face is to identify the existing 3D structure that correlates with the line drawing while also allowing the creation of new structure that is not present in the real world. We propose a labeling algorithm to tackle this problem, where some of the labels capture dominant orientations of the real scene while a free label allows the discovery of new orientations in the imaginary scene. We illustrate our algorithm by interpreting line drawings for urban planing, home remodeling, furniture design and cultural heritage.

Distractors are the regions of an image that draw attention away from the main subjects and reduce the overall image quality. Removing distractors --- for example, using in-painting --- can improve the composition of an image. In this work we created two datasets of images with user annotations to identify the characteristics of distractors. We use these datasets to train an algorithm to predict distractor maps. Finally, we use our predictor to automatically enhance images.

    * Abstract: Satellite imagery is a valuable source of information for assessing damages in distressed areas undergoing a calamity, such as an earthquake or an armed conflict. However, the sheer amount of data required to be inspected for this assessment makes it impractical to do it manually. To address this problem, we present a semi-supervised learning framework for large-scale damage detection in satellite imagery. We present a comparative evaluation of our framework using over 88 million images collected from 4,665 square kilometers from 12 different locations around the world. To enable accurate and efficient damage detection, we introduce a novel use of hierarchical shape features in the bags-of-visual words setting. We analyze how practical factors such as sun, sensor-resolution, and satellite-angle differences impact the effectiveness of our proposed representation, and compare it to five alternative features in multiple learning settings. Finally, we demonstrate through a user-study that our semi-supervised framework results in a ten-fold reduction in human annotation time at a minimal loss in detection accuracy compared to an exhaustive manual inspection.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of model-free online object tracking based on color representations. According to the findings of recent benchmark evaluations, such trackers often tend to drift towards regions which exhibit a similar appearance compared to the object of interest. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient discriminative object model which allows us to identify potentially distracting regions in advance. Furthermore, we exploit this knowledge to adapt the object representation beforehand so that distractors are suppressed and the risk of drifting is significantly reduced. We evaluate our approach on recent online tracking benchmark datasets demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, our approach performs favorably both in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to recent tracking algorithms. Moreover, the proposed approach allows for an efficient implementation to enable online object tracking in real-time.

A special structure formed by basic and nonbasic variables in each stage of the algorithm is identified and utilized to perform the whole iterative process combinatorially over the input energy minimization graph rather than algebraically over the simplex tableau. This leads to a new efficient solver. We demonstrate that for some computer vision instances it performs even better than methods reducing binary energy minimization to finding maximum flow in a network.

    * Abstract: We present a practical and inexpensive method to reconstruct 3D scenes that include piece-wise planar transparent objects. Our work is motivated by the need for automatically generating 3D models of interior scenes, in which glass structures are common. These large structures are often invisible to cameras or even our human visual system. Existing 3D reconstruction methods for transparent objects are usually not applicable in such a room-size reconstruction setting. Our approach augments a regular depth camera (e.g., the Microsoft Kinect camera) with a single ultrasonic sensor, which is able to measure distance to any objects, including transparent surfaces. We present a novel sensor fusion algorithm that first segments the depth map into different categories such as opaque/transparent/infinity (e.g., too far to measure) and then updates the depth map based on the segmentation outcome. Our current hardware setup can generate only one additional point measurement per frame, yet our fusion algorithm is able to generate satisfactory reconstruction results based on our probabilistic model. We highlight the performance in many challenging indoor benchmarks.

    * Abstract: The morphology of glands has been used routinely by pathologists to assess the malignancy degree of adenocarcinomas. Accurate segmentation of glands from histology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphological statistics for quantitative diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed an efficient deep contour-aware network (DCAN) to solve this challenging problem under a unified multi-task learning framework. In the proposed network, multi-level contextual features from the hierarchical architecture are explored with auxiliary supervision for accurate gland segmentation. When incorporated with multi-task regularization during the training, the discriminative capability of intermediate features can be further improved. Moreover, our network can not only output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours simultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland segmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied to large-scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to generate contours based on low-level cues for post-separating. Our method won the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge out of 13 competitive teams, surpassing all the other methods by a significant margin.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the spatial layout of an indoor scene from a monocular RGB image, modeled as the projection of a 3D cuboid. Existing solutions to this problem often rely strongly on hand-engineered features and vanishing point detection, which are prone to failure in the presence of clutter. In this paper, we present a method that uses a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) in conjunction with a novel optimization framework for generating layout estimates. We demonstrate that our method is robust in the presence of clutter and handles a wide range of highly challenging scenes. We evaluate our method on two standard benchmarks and show that it achieves state of the art results, outperforming previous methods by a wide margin.

    * Abstract: Interactive image segmentation is an important problem in computer vision with many applications including image editing, object recognition and image retrieval. Most existing interactive segmentation methods only operate on color images. Until recently, very few works have been proposed to leverage depth information from low-cost sensors to improve interactive segmentation. While these methods achieve better results than color-based methods, they are still limited in either using depth as an additional color channel or simply combining depth with color in a linear way. We propose a novel interactive segmentation algorithm which can incorporate multiple feature cues like color, depth, and normals in an unified graph cut framework to leverage these cues more effectively. A key contribution of our method is that it automatically selects a single cue to be used at each pixel, based on the intuition that only one cue is necessary to determine the segmentation label locally. This is achieved by optimizing over both segmentation labels and cue labels, using terms designed to decide where both the segmentation and label cues should change. Our algorithm thus produces not only the segmentation mask but also a cue label map that indicates where each cue contributes to the final result. Extensive experiments on five large scale RGBD datasets show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than both other color-based and RGBD based algorithms in reducing the amount of user inputs as well as increasing segmentation accuracy.

However, all current data-driven edge detectors require manual supervision for training in the form of hand-labeled region segments or object boundaries. Specifically, human annotators mark semantically meaningful edges which are subsequently used for training. Is this form of strong, high-level supervision actually necessary to learn to accurately detect edges? In this work we present a simple yet effective approach for training edge detectors without human supervision. To this end we utilize motion, and more specifically, the only input to our method is noisy semi-dense matches between frames. We begin with only a rudimentary knowledge of edges (in the form of image gradients), and alternate between improving motion estimation and edge detection in turn. Using a large corpus of video data, we show that edge detectors trained using our unsupervised scheme approach the performance of the same methods trained with full supervision (within 3-5%). Finally, we show that when using a deep network for the edge detector, our approach provides a novel pre-training scheme for object detection.

    * Authors: Rene Ranftl, Vibhav Vineet, Qifeng Chen, Vladlen Koltun
    * Abstract: We present an approach to dense depth estimation from a single monocular camera that is moving through a dynamic scene. The approach produces a dense depth map from two consecutive frames. Moving objects are reconstructed along with the surrounding environment. We provide a novel motion segmentation algorithm that segments the optical flow field into a set of motion models, each with its own epipolar geometry. We then show that the scene can be reconstructed based on these motion models by optimizing a convex program. The optimization jointly reasons about the scales of different objects and assembles the scene in a common coordinate frame, determined up to a global scale. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior methods for monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes.

    * Authors: Taiki Sekii
    * Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for tracking multiple moving objects and recovering their three-dimensional (3D) models separately using multiple calibrated cameras. For robustly tracking objects with similar appearances, the proposed method uses geometric information regarding 3D scene structure rather than appearance. A major limitation of previous techniques is foreground confusion, in which the shapes of objects and/or ghosting artifacts are ignored and are hence not appropriately specified in foreground regions. To overcome this limitation, our method classifies foreground voxels into targets (objects and artifacts) in each frame using a novel, probabilistic two-stage framework. This is accomplished by step-wise application of a track graph describing how targets interact and the maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm for the estimation of target parameters. We introduce mixture models with semiparametric component distributions regarding 3D target shapes. In order to not confuse artifacts with objects of interest, we automatically detect and track artifacts based on a closed-world assumption. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on seven public sequences while achieving real-time performance.

    * Abstract: Interactive object selection is a very important research problem and has many applications. Previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to estimate the foreground and background distributions. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based algorithm which has much better understanding of objectness and can reduce user interactions to just a few clicks. Our algorithm transforms user-provided positive and negative clicks into two Euclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the RBG channels of images to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. We generate many of such pairs by combining several random sampling strategies to model users' click patterns and use them to finetune deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). Finally the output probability maps of our FCN-8s model is integrated with graph cut optimization to refine the boundary segments. Our model is trained on the PASCAL segmentation dataset and evaluated on other datasets with different object classes. Experimental results on both seen and unseen objects clearly demonstrate that our algorithm has a good generalization ability and is superior to all existing interactive object selection approaches.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose an unconventional approach for text detection in natural images. Both global and local cues are taken into account for localizing text lines in a coarse-to-fine procedure. First, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model is trained for predicting a salient map of text regions in a holistic manner. Then, a set of hypotheses text lines are estimated by combining the salient map and MSER components. Finally, another FCN classifier is used for predicting the centroid of each character, in order to remove the false hypotheses. The framework is general for handling texts in multiple orientations, languages and fonts. The proposed method consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three text detection benchmarks: MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015, and ICDAR2013.

    * Authors: Floris F. Berendsen, Kasper Marstal, Stefan Klein, Marius Staring
    * Abstract: A large diversity of image registration methodologies has emerged from the research community. The scattering of methods over toolboxes impedes rigorous comparison to select the appropriate method for a given application. Toolboxes typically tailor their implementations to a mathematical registration paradigm, which makes internal functionality nonexchangeable. Subsequently, this forms a barrier for adoption of registration technology in the clinic. We therefore propose a unifying, role-based software design that can integrate a broad range of functional registration components. These components can be configured into an algorithmic network via a single high-level user interface. A generic component handshake mechanism provides users feedback on incompatibilities. We demonstrate the viability of our design by incorporating two paradigms from different code bases. The implementation is done in C++ and is available as open source. The progress of embedding more paradigms can be followed via https://github.com/kaspermarstal/SuperElastix

    * Abstract: We propose a comprehensive method using multiscale and multicycle features for retinal vessel image registration with a local and global strategy. The multiscale vessel maps generated by multiwavelet kernels and multiscale hierarchical decomposition contain segmentation results at varying image resolutions in different levels of vessel details. Then the multicycle feature composed of various combinations of cycle structures with different numbers of vertices is extracted. The cycle structure consisting of vessel bifurcation points, crossover points of arteries and veins, and the connected vessels can be found by our Angle-based Depth-First Search (ADFS) algorithm. Local initial registration is implemented by the matched Cycle-Vessel feature points and global final registration is completed by the Cycle-Vessel-Bifurcation feature points using similarity transformation. Finally, our Skeleton Alignment Error Measure (SAEM) is calculated for optimal scale and cycle feature selection, yielding the best registration result intelligently. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on retinal vessel image registration using different features in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Our approach combines intuitions from the classical watershed transform and modern deep learning to produce an energy map of the image where object instances are unambiguously represented as energy basins. We then perform a cut at a single energy level to directly yield connected components corresponding to object instances. Our model achieves more than double the performance over the state-of-the-art on the challenging Cityscapes Instance Level Segmentation task.

    * Abstract: Localizing a query image against a 3D model at large scale is a hard problem, since 2D-3D matches become more and more ambiguous as the model size increases. This creates a need for pose estimation strategies that can handle very low inlier ratios. In this paper, we draw new insights on the geometric information available from the 2D-3D matching process. As modern descriptors are not invariant against large variations in viewpoint, we are able to find the rays in space used to triangulate a given point that are closest to a query descriptor. It is well known that two correspondences constrain the camera to lie on the surface of a torus. Adding the knowledge of direction of triangulation, we are able to approximate the position of the camera from two matches alone. We derive a geometric solver that can compute this position in under 1 microsecond. Using this solver, we propose a simple yet powerful outlier filter which scales quadratically in the number of matches. We validate the accuracy of our solver and demonstrate the usefulness of our method in real world settings.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection has attracted great attention these years. Text potentially exist in a wide variety of images or videos and play an important role in understanding the scene. In this paper, we present a novel text detection algorithm which is composed of two cascaded steps: (1) a multi-scale fully convolutional neural network (FCN) is proposed to extract text block regions; (2) a novel instance (word or line) aware segmentation is designed to further remove false positives and obtain word instances. The proposed algorithm can accurately localize word or text line in arbitrary orientations, including curved text lines which cannot be handled in a lot of other frameworks. Our algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance in ICDAR 2013 (IC13), ICDAR 2015 (IC15) and CUTE80 and Street View Text (SVT) benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach for articulated tracking of multiple people in unconstrained videos. Our starting point is a model that resembles existing architectures for single-frame pose estimation but is substantially faster. We achieve this in two ways: (1) by simplifying and sparsifying the body-part relationship graph and leveraging recent methods for faster inference, and (2) by offloading a substantial share of computation onto a feed-forward convolutional architecture that is able to detect and associate body joints of the same person even in clutter. We use this model to generate proposals for body joint locations and formulate articulated tracking as spatio-temporal grouping of such proposals. This allows to jointly solve the association problem for all people in the scene by propagating evidence from strong detections through time and enforcing constraints that each proposal can be assigned to one person only. We report results on a public "MPII Human Pose" benchmark and on a new "MPII Video Pose" dataset of image sequences with multiple people. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results while using only a fraction of time and is able to leverage temporal information to improve state-of-the-art for crowded scenes.

    * Abstract: Detecting incidental scene text is a challenging task because of multi-orientation, perspective distortion, and variation of text size, color and scale. Retrospective research has only focused on using rectangular bounding box or horizontal sliding window to localize text, which may result in redundant background noise, unnecessary overlap or even information loss. To address these issues, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based method, named Deep Matching Prior Network (DMPNet), to detect text with tighter quadrangle. First, we use quadrilateral sliding windows in several specific intermediate convolutional layers to roughly recall the text with higher overlapping area and then a shared Monte-Carlo method is proposed for fast and accurate computing of the polygonal areas. After that, we designed a sequential protocol for relative regression which can exactly predict text with compact quadrangle. Moreover, a auxiliary smooth Ln loss is also proposed for further regressing the position of text, which has better overall performance than L2 loss and smooth L1 loss in terms of robustness and stability. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on a public word-level, multi-oriented scene text database, ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition Challenge 4 "Incidental scene text localization". The performance of our method is evaluated by using F-measure and found to be 70.64%, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art method with F-measure 63.76%.

    * Abstract: Given a state-of-the-art deep neural network classifier, we show the existence of a universal (image-agnostic) and very small perturbation vector that causes natural images to be misclassified with high probability. We propose a systematic algorithm for computing universal perturbations, and show that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to such perturbations, albeit being quasi-imperceptible to the human eye. We further empirically analyze these universal perturbations and show, in particular, that they generalize very well across neural networks. The surprising existence of universal perturbations reveals important geometric correlations among the high-dimensional decision boundary of classifiers. It further outlines potential security breaches with the existence of single directions in the input space that adversaries can possibly exploit to break a classifier on most natural images.

    * Abstract: Given the recent advances in depth prediction from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this paper investigates how predicted depth maps from a deep neural network can be deployed for the goal of accurate and dense monocular reconstruction. We propose a method where CNN-predicted dense depth maps are naturally fused together with depth measurements obtained from direct monocular SLAM, based on a scheme that privileges depth prediction in image locations where monocular SLAM approaches tend to fail, e.g. along low-textured regions, and vice-versa. We demonstrate the use of depth prediction to estimate the absolute scale of the reconstruction, hence overcoming one of the major limitations of monocular SLAM. Finally, we propose a framework to efficiently fuse semantic labels, obtained from a single frame, with dense SLAM, so to yield semantically coherent scene reconstruction from a single view. Evaluation results on two benchmark datasets show the robustness and accuracy of our approach.

    * Abstract: Scene-text detection in natural-scene images is an important technique because scene texts contain location information such as names of places and buildings, but many difficulties still remain regarding practical use. In this paper, we tackle two problems of scene-text detection. The first is the discontiguous component problem in specific languages that contain characters consisting of discontiguous components. The second is the multi-orientation problem in all languages. To solve these two problems, we propose a connected-component-based scene-text-detection method. Our proposed method involves our novel neighbor-character search method using a synthesizable descriptor for the discontiguous-component problems and our novel region descriptor called the rotated bounding box descriptors (RBBs) for rotated characters. We also evaluated our proposed scene-text-detection method by using the well-known MSRA-TD500 dataset that includes rotated characters with discontiguous components.

    * Abstract: Currently, the only mass-market service robots are floor cleaners and lawn mowers. Although available for more than 20 years, they mostly lack intelligent functions from modern robot research. In particular, the obstacle detection and avoidance is typically a simple physical collision detection. In this work, we discuss a prototype autonomous lawn mower with camera-based non-contact obstacle avoidance. We devised a low-cost compact module consisting of color cameras and an ARM-based processing board, which can be added to an autonomous lawn mower with minimal effort. For testing our system, we conducted a field test with 20 prototype units distributed in eight European countries with a total mowing time of 3,494 hours. The results show that our proposed system is able to work without expert interaction for a full season and strongly reduces collision events while still keeping the good mowing performance.

    * Abstract: Semantic classes can be either things (objects with a well-defined shape, e.g. car, person) or stuff (amorphous background regions, e.g. grass, sky). While lots of classification and detection works focus on thing classes, less attention has been given to stuff classes. Nonetheless, stuff classes are important as they allow to explain important aspects of an image, including (1) scene type; (2) which thing classes are likely to be present and their location (through contextual reasoning); (3) physical attributes, material types and geometric properties of the scene. To understand stuff and things in context we introduce COCO-Stuff, which augments all 164K images of the COCO 2017 dataset with pixel-wise annotations for 91 stuff classes. We introduce an efficient stuff annotation protocol based on superpixels, which leverages the original thing annotations. We quantify the speed versus quality trade-off of our protocol and explore the relation between annotation time and boundary complexity. Furthermore, we use COCO-Stuff to analyze: (a) the importance of stuff and thing classes in terms of their surface cover and how frequently they are mentioned in image captions; (b) the spatial relations between stuff and things, highlighting the rich contextual relations that make our dataset unique; (c) the performance of a modern semantic segmentation method on stuff and thing classes, and whether stuff is easier to segment than things.

    * Abstract: Single-view depth prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recently, deep learning methods have led to significant progress, but such methods are limited by the available training data. Current datasets based on 3D sensors have key limitations, including indoor-only images (NYU), small numbers of training examples (Make3D), and sparse sampling (KITTI). We propose to use multi-view Internet photo collections, a virtually unlimited data source, to generate training data via modern structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo (MVS) methods, and present a large depth dataset called MegaDepth based on this idea. Data derived from MVS comes with its own challenges, including noise and unreconstructable objects. We address these challenges with new data cleaning methods, as well as automatically augmenting our data with ordinal depth relations generated using semantic segmentation. We validate the use of large amounts of Internet data by showing that models trained on MegaDepth exhibit strong generalization—not only to novel scenes, but also to other diverse datasets including Make3D, KITTI, and DIW, even when no images from those datasets are seen during training.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a prior-less method for tracking and clustering an unknown number of human faces and maintaining their individual identities in unconstrained videos. The key challenge is to accurately track faces with partial occlusion and drastic appearance changes in multiple shots resulting from significant variations of makeup, facial expression, head pose and illumination. To address this challenge, we propose a new multi-face tracking and re-identification algorithm, which provides high accuracy in face association in the entire video with automatic cluster number generation, and is robust to outliers. We develop a co-occurrence model of multiple body parts to seamlessly create face tracklets, and recursively link tracklets to construct a graph for extracting clusters. A Gaussian Process model is introduced to compensate the deep feature insufficiency, and is further used to refine the linking results. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using a variety of challenging music videos and newly introduced body-worn camera videos. The proposed method obtains significant improvements over the state of the art [51], while relying less on handling video-specific prior information to achieve high performance.

In this work, we propose a unified end-to-end trainable Fast Oriented Text Spotting (FOTS) network for simultaneous detection and recognition, sharing computation and visual information among the two complementary tasks. Specifically, RoIRotate is introduced to share convolutional features between detection and recognition. Benefiting from convolution sharing strategy, our FOTS has little computation overhead compared to baseline text detection network, and the joint training method makes our method perform better than these two-stage methods. Experiments on ICDAR 2015, ICDAR 2017 MLT, and ICDAR 2013 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, which further allows us to develop the first real-time oriented text spotting system which surpasses all previous state-of-the-art results by more than 5% on ICDAR 2015 text spotting task while keeping 22.6 fps.

    * Abstract: We propose a weakly supervised temporal action localization algorithm on untrimmed videos using convolutional neural networks. Our algorithm learns from video-level class labels and predicts temporal intervals of human actions with no requirement of temporal localization annotations. We design our network to identify a sparse subset of key segments associated with target actions in a video using an attention module and fuse the key segments through adaptive temporal pooling. Our loss function is comprised of two terms that minimize the video-level action classification error and enforce the sparsity of the segment selection. At inference time, we extract and score temporal proposals using temporal class activations and class-agnostic attentions to estimate the time intervals that correspond to target actions. The proposed algorithm attains state-of-the-art results on the THUMOS14 dataset and outstanding performance on ActivityNet1.3 even with its weak supervision.

    * Abstract: Localizing text in the wild is challenging in the situations of complicated geometric layout of the targets like random orientation and large aspect ratio. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware modeling approach tailored for scene text representation with an end-to-end learning scheme. In our approach, a novel Instance Transformation Network (ITN) is presented to learn the geometry-aware representation encoding the unique geometric configurations of scene text instances with in-network transformation embedding, resulting in a robust and elegant framework to detect words or text lines at one pass. An end-to-end multi-task learning strategy with transformation regression, text/non-text classification and coordinate regression is adopted in the ITN. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting scene text in various geometric configurations.

    * Abstract: 3D fluorescence microscopy continues to pose challenging tasks with more experiments leading to identifying new physiological patterns in cells' life cycle and activity. It then falls on the hands of biologists to annotate this imagery which is laborious and time-consuming, especially with noisy images and hard to see and track patterns. Modeling of automation tasks that can handle depth-varying light conditions and noise, and other challenges inherent in 3D fluorescence microscopy often becomes complex and requires high processing power and memory. This paper presents an efficient methodology for the localization, classification, and tracking in fluorescence microscopy imagery by taking advantage of time sequential images in 4D data. We show the application of our proposed method on the challenging task of localizing and tracking microtubule fibers' bridge formation during the cell division of zebrafish embryos where we achieve 98% accuracy and 0.94 F1- score.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised method for extracting objects from urine microscopy images and also applied U-net for extracting these objects. We fused these proposed methods with a known edge thresholding technique from an existing work on segmentation of urine microscopic images. Comparison between our proposed methods and the existing work showed that for certain object types the proposed unsupervised method with or without edge thresholding outperforms the other methods, while in other cases the U-net method with or without edge thresholding outperforms the other methods. Overall the proposed unsupervised method along with edge thresholding worked the best by extracting maximum number of objects and minimum number of artifacts. On a test dataset, the artifact to object ratio for the proposed unsupervised method was 0.71, which is significantly better than that of 1.26 for the existing work. The proposed unsupervised method along with edge thresholding extracted 3208 objects as compared to 1608 by the existing work. To the best of our knowledge this is the first application of Deep Learning for extraction of clinically significant objects in urine microscopy images.

    * Abstract: Advances in fluorescence microscopy enable acquisition of 3D image volumes with better image quality and deeper penetration into tissue. Segmentation is a required step to characterize and analyze biological structures in the images and recent 3D segmentation using deep learning has achieved promising results. One issue is that deep learning techniques require a large set of groundtruth data which is impractical to annotate manually for large 3D microscopy volumes. This paper describes a 3D deep learning nuclei segmentation method using synthetic 3D volumes for training. A set of synthetic volumes and the corresponding groundtruth are generated using spatially constrained cycle-consistent adversarial networks. Segmentation results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of segmenting nuclei successfully for various data sets.

    * Abstract: Cell deformation is regulated by complex underlying biological mechanisms associated with spatial and temporal morphological changes in the nucleus that are related to cell differentiation, development, proliferation, and disease. Thus, quantitative analysis of changes in size and shape of nuclear structures in 3D microscopic images is important not only for investigating nuclear organization, but also for detecting and treating pathological conditions such as cancer. While many efforts have been made to develop cell and nuclear shape characteristics in 2D or pseudo-3D, several studies have suggested that 3D morphometric measures provide better results for nuclear shape description and discrimination. A few methods have been proposed to classify cell and nuclear morphological phenotypes in 3D, however, there is a lack of publicly available 3D data for the evaluation and comparison of such algorithms. This limitation becomes of great importance when the ability to evaluate different approaches on benchmark data is needed for better dissemination of the current state of the art methods for bioimage analysis. To address this problem, we present a dataset containing two different cell collections, including original 3D microscopic images of cell nuclei and nucleoli. In addition, we perform a baseline evaluation of a number of popular classification algorithms using 2D and 3D voxel-based morphometric measures. To account for batch effects, while enabling calculations of AUROC and AUPR performance metrics, we propose a specific cross-validation scheme that we compare with commonly used k-fold cross-validation. Original and derived imaging data are made publicly available on the project web-page: http://www.socr.umich.edu/projects/3d-cell-morphometry/data.html.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection methods based on neural networks have emerged recently and have shown promising results. Previous methods trained with rigid word-level bounding boxes exhibit limitations in representing the text region in an arbitrary shape. In this paper, we propose a new scene text detection method to effectively detect text area by exploring each character and affinity between characters. To overcome the lack of individual character level annotations, our proposed framework exploits both the given character-level annotations for synthetic images and the estimated character-level ground-truths for real images acquired by the learned interim model. In order to estimate affinity between characters, the network is trained with the newly proposed representation for affinity. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including the TotalText and CTW-1500 datasets which contain highly curved texts in natural images, demonstrate that our character-level text detection significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors. According to the results, our proposed method guarantees high flexibility in detecting complicated scene text images, such as arbitrarily-oriented, curved, or deformed texts.

    * Abstract: We propose an effective deep learning approach to aesthetics quality assessment that relies on a new type of pre-trained features, and apply it to the AVA data set, the currently largest aesthetics database. While previous approaches miss some of the information in the original images, due to taking small crops, down-scaling or warping the originals during training, we propose the first method that efficiently supports full resolution images as an input, and can be trained on variable input sizes. This allows us to significantly improve upon the state of the art, increasing the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC) of ground-truth mean opinion scores (MOS) from the existing best reported of 0.612 to 0.756. To achieve this performance, we extract multi-level spatially pooled (MLSP) features from all convolutional blocks of a pre-trained InceptionResNet-v2 network, and train a custom shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture on these new features.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we address a new task called instance co-segmentation. Given a set of images jointly covering object instances of a specific category, instance co-segmentation aims to identify all of these instances and segment each of them, i.e. generating one mask for each instance. This task is important since instance-level segmentation is preferable for humans and many vision applications. It is also challenging because no pixel-wise annotated training data are available and the number of instances in each image is unknown. We solve this task by dividing it into two sub-tasks, co-peak search and instance mask segmentation. In the former sub-task, we develop a CNN-based network to detect the co-peaks as well as co-saliency maps for a pair of images. A co-peak has two endpoints, one in each image, that are local maxima in the response maps and similar to each other. Thereby, the two endpoints are potentially covered by a pair of instances of the same category. In the latter subtask, we design a ranking function that takes the detected co-peaks and co-saliency maps as inputs and can select the object proposals to produce the final results. Our method for instance co-segmentation and its variant for object colocalization are evaluated on four datasets, and achieve favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: Parts provide a good intermediate representation of objects that is robust with respect to camera, pose and appearance variations. Existing work on part segmentation is dominated by supervised approaches that rely on large amounts of manual annotations and also can not generalize to unseen object categories. We propose a self-supervised deep learning approach for part segmentation, where we devise several loss functions that aids in predicting part segments that are geometrically concentrated, robust to object variations and are also semantically consistent across different object instances. Extensive experiments on different types of image collections demonstrate that our approach can produce part segments that adhere to object boundaries and also more semantically consistent across object instances compared to existing self-supervised techniques.

    * Abstract: Creating high definition maps that contain precise information of static elements of the scene is of utmost importance for enabling self driving cars to drive safely. In this paper, we tackle the problem of drivable road boundary extraction from LiDAR and camera imagery. Towards this goal, we design a structured model where a fully convolutional network obtains deep features encoding the location and direction of road boundaries and then, a convolutional recurrent network outputs a polyline representation for each one of them. Importantly, our method is fully automatic and does not require a user in the loop. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a large North American city where we obtain perfect topology of road boundaries 99.3% of the time at a high precision and recall.

In Polygon-RNN++, the authors proposed Polygon-RNN that produces polygonal annotations in a recurrent manner using a CNN-RNN architecture, allowing interactive correction via humans-in-the-loop. We propose a new framework that alleviates the sequential nature of Polygon-RNN, by predicting all vertices simultaneously using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Our model is trained end-to-end, and runs in real time. It supports object annotation by either polygons or splines, facilitating labeling efficiency for both line-based and curved objects. We show that Curve-GCN outperforms all existing approaches in automatic mode, including the powerful DeepLab, and is significantly more efficient in interactive mode than Polygon-RNN++. Our model runs at 29.3ms in automatic, and 2.6ms in interactive mode, making it 10x and 100x faster than Polygon-RNN++.

    * Abstract: Current 3D detection networks either rely on 2D object proposals or try to directly predict bounding box parameters from each point in a scene. While former methods are dependent on performance of 2D detectors, latter approaches are challenging due to the sparsity and occlusion in point clouds, making it difficult to regress accurate parameters. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for 3D object detection that is significant in two main aspects: a) cascaded modular approach that focuses the receptive field of each module on specific points in the point cloud, for improved feature learning and b) a class agnostic instance segmentation module that is initiated using unsupervised clustering. The objective of a cascaded approach is to sequentially minimize the number of points running through the network. While three different modules perform the tasks of background-foreground segmentation, class agnostic instance segmentation and object detection, through individually trained point based networks. We also evaluate bayesian uncertainty in modules, demonstrating the over all level of confidence in our prediction results. Performance of the network is evaluated on the SUN RGB-D benchmark dataset, that demonstrates an improvement as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) has gained popularity over the last years for its promise to train localization models with only image-level labels. Since the seminal WSOL work of class activation mapping (CAM), the field has focused on how to expand the attention regions to cover objects more broadly and localize them better. However, these strategies rely on full localization supervision to validate hyperparameters and for model selection, which is in principle prohibited under the WSOL setup. In this paper, we argue that WSOL task is ill-posed with only image-level labels, and propose a new evaluation protocol where full supervision is limited to only a small held-out set not overlapping with the test set. We observe that, under our protocol, the five most recent WSOL methods have not made a major improvement over the CAM baseline. Moreover, we report that existing WSOL methods have not reached the few-shot learning baseline, where the full-supervision at validation time is used for model training instead. Based on our findings, we discuss some future directions for WSOL.

    * Abstract: We present a new instance segmentation approach tailored to biological images, where instances may correspond to individual cells, organisms or plant parts. Unlike instance segmentation for user photographs or road scenes, in biological data object instances may be particularly densely packed, the appearance variation may be particularly low, the processing power may be restricted, while, on the other hand, the variability of sizes of individual instances may be limited. The proposed approach successfully addresses these peculiarities. Our approach describes each object instance using an expectation of a limited number of sine waves with frequencies and phases adjusted to particular object sizes and densities. At train time, a fully-convolutional network is learned to predict the object embeddings at each pixel using a simple pixelwise regression loss, while at test time the instances are recovered using clustering in the embedding space. In the experiments, we show that our approach outperforms previous embedding-based instance segmentation approaches on a number of biological datasets, achieving state-of-the-art on a popular CVPPP benchmark. This excellent performance is combined with computational efficiency that is needed for deployment to domain specialists. The source code of the approach is available at https://github.com/kulikovv/harmonic .

    * Abstract: Contrast maximisation estimates the motion captured in an event stream by maximising the sharpness of the motion-compensated event image. To carry out contrast maximisation, many previous works employ iterative optimisation algorithms, such as conjugate gradient, which require good initialisation to avoid converging to bad local minima. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a new globally optimal event-based motion estimation algorithm. Based on branch-and-bound (BnB), our method solves rotational (3DoF) motion estimation on event streams, which supports practical applications such as video stabilisation and attitude estimation. Underpinning our method are novel bounding functions for contrast maximisation, whose theoretical validity is rigorously established. We show concrete examples from public datasets where globally optimal solutions are vital to the success of contrast maximisation. Despite its exact nature, our algorithm is currently able to process a 50,000-event input in approx 300 seconds (a locally optimal solver takes approx 30 seconds on the same input), and has the potential to be further speeded-up using GPUs.

    * Abstract: Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) algorithms are based on the component tree and are used to detect invariant regions. OpenCV MSER, the most popular MSER implementation, uses a linked list to associate pixels with ERs. The data-structure of an ER contains the attributes of a head and a tail linked node, which makes OpenCV MSER hard to be performed in parallel using existing parallel component tree strategies. Besides, pixel extraction (i.e. extracting the pixels in MSERs) in OpenCV MSER is very slow. In this paper, we propose two novel MSER algorithms, called Fast MSER V1 and V2. They first divide an image into several spatial partitions, then construct sub-trees and doubly linked lists (for V1) or a labelled image (for V2) on the partitions in parallel. A novel sub-tree merging algorithm is used in V1 to merge the sub-trees into the final tree, and the doubly linked lists are also merged in the process. While V2 merges the sub-trees using an existing merging algorithm. Finally, MSERs are recognized, the pixels in them are extracted through two novel pixel extraction methods taking advantage of the fact that a lot of pixels in parent and child MSERs are duplicated. Both V1 and V2 outperform three open source MSER algorithms (28 and 26 times faster than OpenCV MSER), and reduce the memory of the pixels in MSERs by 78%.

    * Abstract: Image extrapolation extends an input image beyond the originally-captured field of view. Existing methods struggle to extrapolate images with salient objects in the foreground or are limited to very specific objects such as humans, but tend to work well on indoor/outdoor scenes. We introduce OCONet (Object COmpletion Networks) to extrapolate foreground objects, with an object completion network conditioned on its class. OCONet uses an encoder-decoder architecture trained with adversarial loss to predict the object's texture as well as its extent, represented as a predicted signed-distance field. An independent step extends the background, and the object is composited on top using the predicted mask. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that we improve on state-of-the-art image extrapolation results for challenging examples.

    * Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural networks that are known to be data-hungry. Region-based active learning has shown to be a promising method for reducing data annotation costs. A key design choice for region-based AL is whether to use regularly-shaped regions (e.g., rectangles) or irregularly-shaped region (e.g., superpixels). In this work, we address this question under realistic, click-based measurement of annotation costs. In particular, we revisit the use of superpixels and demonstrate that the inappropriate choice of cost measure (e.g., the percentage of labeled pixels), may cause the effectiveness of the superpixel-based approach to be under-estimated. We benchmark the superpixel-based approach against the traditional "rectangle+polygon"-based approach with annotation cost measured in clicks, and show that the former outperforms on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC. We further propose a class-balanced acquisition function to boost the performance of the superpixel-based approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on the evaluation datasets. Our results strongly argue for the use of superpixel-based AL for semantic segmentation and highlight the importance of using realistic annotation costs in evaluating such methods.

    * Abstract: The recent trend in multiple object tracking (MOT) is heading towards leveraging deep learning to boost the tracking performance. However, it is not trivial to solve the data-association problem in an end-to-end fashion. In this paper, we propose a novel proposal-based learnable framework, which models MOT as a proposal generation, proposal scoring and trajectory inference paradigm on an affinity graph. This framework is similar to the two-stage object detector Faster RCNN, and can solve the MOT problem in a data-driven way. For proposal generation, we propose an iterative graph clustering method to reduce the computational cost while maintaining the quality of the generated proposals. For proposal scoring, we deploy a trainable graph-convolutional-network (GCN) to learn the structural patterns of the generated proposals and rank them according to the estimated quality scores. For trajectory inference, a simple deoverlapping strategy is adopted to generate tracking output while complying with the constraints that no detection can be assigned to more than one track. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a clear performance improvement in both MOTA and IDF1 with respect to previous state-of-the-art on two public benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/daip13/LPC_MOT.git.

    * Abstract: We present a simple regularization of adversarial perturbations based upon the perceptual loss. While the resulting perturbations remain imperceptible to the human eye, they differ from existing adversarial perturbations in that they are semi-sparse alterations that highlight objects and regions of interest while leaving the background unaltered. As a semantically meaningful adverse perturbations, it forms a bridge between counterfactual explanations and adversarial perturbations in the space of images. We evaluate our approach on several standard explainability benchmarks, namely, weak localization, insertion deletion, and the pointing game demonstrating that perceptually regularized counterfactuals are an effective explanation for image-based classifiers.

    * Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting and tracking moving objects in 3D, in unlabelled RGB-D videos. The method begins with classic handcrafted techniques for segmenting objects using motion cues: we estimate optical flow and camera motion, and conservatively segment regions that appear to be moving independently of the background. Treating these initial segments as pseudo-labels, we learn an ensemble of appearance-based 2D and 3D detectors, under heavy data augmentation. We use this ensemble to detect new instances of the "moving" type, even if they are not moving, and add these as new pseudo-labels. Our method is an expectation-maximization algorithm, where in the expectation step we fire all modules and look for agreement among them, and in the maximization step we re-train the modules to improve this agreement. The constraint of ensemble agreement helps combat contamination of the generated pseudo-labels (during the E step), and data augmentation helps the modules generalize to yet-unlabelled data (during the M step). We compare against existing unsupervised object discovery and tracking methods, using challenging videos from CATER and KITTI, and show strong improvements over the state-of-the-art.

    * Abstract: Recently, neural architecture search(NAS) has been applied to automatically search high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. The NAS search space usually contains a network topology level(controlling connections among cells with different spatial scales) and a cell level(operations within each cell). Existing methods either require long searching time for large-scale 3D image datasets, or are limited to pre-defined topologies (such as U-shaped or single-path). In this work, we focus on three important aspects of NAS in 3D medical image segmentation: flexible multi-path network topology, high search efficiency, and budgeted GPU memory usage. A novel differentiable search framework is proposed to support fast gradient-based search within a highly flexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched optimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal final discrete model (discretization gap). Therefore, we propose a topology loss to alleviate this problem. In addition, the GPU memory usage for the searched 3D model is limited with budget constraints during search. Our Differentiable Network Topology Search scheme(DiNTS) is evaluated on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, which contains ten challenging segmentation tasks. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and the top ranking on the MSD challenge leaderboard.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel technique for producing high-quality 3D models that match a given target object image or scan. Our method is based on retrieving an existing shape from a database of 3D models and then deforming its parts to match the target shape. Unlike previous approaches that independently focus on either shape retrieval or deformation, we propose a joint learning procedure that simultaneously trains the neural deformation module along with the embedding space used by the retrieval module. This enables our network to learn a deformation-aware embedding space, so that retrieved models are more amenable to match the target after an appropriate deformation. In fact, we use the embedding space to guide the shape pairs used to train the deformation module, so that it invests its capacity in learning deformations between meaningful shape pairs. Furthermore, our novel part-aware deformation module can work with inconsistent and diverse part-structures on the source shapes. We demonstrate the benefits of our joint training not only on our novel framework, but also on other state-of-the-art neural deformation modules proposed in recent years. Lastly, we also show that our jointly-trained method outperforms various non-joint baselines.

    * Authors: Xiaogang Wang, Xun Sun, Xinyu Cao, Kai Xu, Bin Zhou
    * Abstract: Existing learning-based approaches to 3D shape segmentation usually formulate it as a semantic labeling problem, assuming that all parts of training shapes are annotated with a given set of labels. This assumption, however, is unrealistic for training fine-grained segmentation on large datasets since the annotation of fine-grained parts is extremely tedious. In this paper, we approach the problem with deep clustering, where the key idea is to learn part priors from a dataset with fine-grained segmentation but no part annotations. Given point sampled 3D shapes, we model the clustering priors of points with a similarity matrix and achieve part-based segmentation through minimizing a novel low rank loss. Further, since fine-grained parts can be very tiny, a 3D shape has to be densely sampled to ensure the tiny parts are well captured and segmented. To handle densely sampled point sets, we adopt a divide-and-conquer scheme. We first partition the large point set into a number of blocks. Each block is segmented using a deep-clustering-based part prior network (PriorNet) trained in a category-agnostic manner. We then train MergeNet, a graph convolution network, to merge the segments of all blocks to form the final segmentation result. Our method is evaluated with a challenging benchmark of fine-grained segmentation, showing significant advantage over the state-of-the-art ones.

    * Abstract: Fast and light-weight methods for animating 3D characters are desirable in various applications such as computer games. We present a learning-based approach to enhance skinning-based animations of 3D characters with vivid secondary motion effects. We represent each local patch of a character simulation mesh as a graph network where the edges implicitly encode the internal forces between the neighboring vertices. We then train a neural network that emulates the ordinary differential equations of the character dynamics, predicting new vertex positions from the current accelerations, velocities and positions. Being a local method, our network is independent of the mesh topology and generalizes to arbitrarily shaped 3D character meshes at test time. We further represent per-vertex constraints and material properties such as stiffness, enabling us to easily adjust the dynamics in different parts of the mesh. We evaluate our method on various character meshes and complex motion sequences. Our method can be over 30 times more efficient than ground-truth physically based simulation, and outperforms alternative solutions that provide fast approximations.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a detection-aware pre-training (DAP) approach, which leverages only weakly-labeled classification-style datasets (e.g., ImageNet) for pre-training, but is specifically tailored to benefit object detection tasks. In contrast to the widely used image classification-based pre-training (e.g., on ImageNet), which does not include any location-related training tasks, we transform a classification dataset into a detection dataset through a weakly supervised object localization method based on Class Activation Maps to directly pre-train a detector, making the pre-trained model location-aware and capable of predicting bounding boxes. We show that DAP can outperform the traditional classification pre-training in terms of both sample efficiency and convergence speed in downstream detection tasks including VOC and COCO. In particular, DAP boosts the detection accuracy by a large margin when the number of examples in the downstream task is small.

Previous work has used a unified sky environment map to represent outdoor lighting. Instead, we generate spatially-varying local lighting environment maps by combining global sky environment map with warped image information according to geometric information estimated from intrinsics. As no outdoor dataset with image and local lighting ground truth is readily available, we introduce SOLID-Img dataset with physically-based rendered images and their corresponding intrinsic and lighting information. We train a deep neural network to regress intrinsic cues with physically-based constrains and use them to conduct global and local lightings estimation. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that SOLID-Net significantly outperforms previous methods.

    * Abstract: Robust and accurate nuclei centroid detection is important for the understanding of biological structures in fluorescence microscopy images. Existing automated nuclei localization methods face three main challenges: (1) Most of object detection methods work only on 2D images and are difficult to extend to 3D volumes; (2) Segmentation-based models can be used on 3D volumes but it is computational expensive for large microscopy volumes and they have difficulty distinguishing different instances of objects; (3) Hand annotated ground truth is limited for 3D microscopy volumes. To address these issues, we present a scalable approach for nuclei centroid detection of 3D microscopy volumes. We describe the RCNN-SliceNet to detect 2D nuclei centroids for each slice of the volume from different directions and 3D agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) is used to estimate the 3D centroids of nuclei in a volume. The model was trained with the synthetic microscopy data generated using Spatially Constrained Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (SpCycleGAN) and tested on different types of real 3D microscopy data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately count and detect the nuclei centroids in a 3D microscopy volume.

Our algorithm consists of three steps executed recursively: (1) Finding conflicted cycles that correspond to violated inequalities of the underlying multicut relaxation, (2) Performing message passing between the edges and cycles to optimize the Lagrange relaxation coming from the found violated cycles producing reduced costs and (3) Contracting edges with high reduced costs through matrix-matrix multiplications. Our algorithm produces primal solutions and lower bounds that estimate the distance to optimum. We implement our algorithm on GPUs and show resulting one to two orders-of-magnitudes improvements in execution speed without sacrificing solution quality compared to traditional sequential algorithms that run on CPUs. We can solve very large scale benchmark problems with up to O(10^8) variables in a few seconds with small primal-dual gaps. Our code is available at https://github.com/pawelswoboda/RAMA.

    * Abstract: Recently, various multimodal networks for Visually-Rich Document Understanding(VRDU) have been proposed, showing the promotion of transformers by integrating visual and layout information with the text embeddings. However, most existing approaches utilize the position embeddings to incorporate the sequence information, neglecting the noisy improper reading order obtained by OCR tools. In this paper, we propose a robust layout-aware multimodal network named XYLayoutLM to capture and leverage rich layout information from proper reading orders produced by our Augmented XY Cut. Moreover, a Dilated Conditional Position Encoding module is proposed to deal with the input sequence of variable lengths, and it additionally extracts local layout information from both textual and visual modalities while generating position embeddings. Experiment results show that our XYLayoutLM achieves competitive results on document understanding tasks.

    * Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of document image dewarping, which aims at eliminating the geometric distortion in document images for document digitization. Instead of designing a better neural network to approximate the optical flow fields between the inputs and outputs, we pursue the best readability by taking the text lines and the document boundaries into account from a constrained optimization perspective. Specifically, our proposed method first learns the boundary points and the pixels in the text lines and then follows the most simple observation that the boundaries and text lines in both horizontal and vertical directions should be kept after dewarping to introduce a novel grid regularization scheme. To obtain the final forward mapping for dewarping, we solve an optimization problem with our proposed grid regularization. The experiments comprehensively demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the prior arts by large margins in terms of readability (with the metrics of Character Errors Rate and the Edit Distance) while maintaining the best image quality on the publicly-available DocUNet benchmark.

    * Abstract: We propose the Neurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP), a method that learns how to assign fine-grained semantic labels to regions of a 3D shape. NGSP solves this problem via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a label assignment conditioned on an input shape with a learned likelihood function. To make this search tractable, NGSP employs a neural guide network that learns to approximate the posterior. NGSP finds high-probability label assignments by first sampling proposals with the guide network and then evaluating each proposal under the full likelihood. We evaluate NGSP on the task of fine-grained semantic segmentation of manufactured 3D shapes from PartNet, where shapes have been decomposed into regions that correspond to part instance over-segmentations. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance improvements over comparison methods that (i) use regions to group per-point predictions, (ii) use regions as a self-supervisory signal or (iii) assign labels to regions under alternative formulations. Further, we show that NGSP maintains strong performance even with limited labeled data or noisy input shape regions. Finally, we demonstrate that NGSP can be directly applied to CAD shapes found in online repositories and validate its effectiveness with a perceptual study.

    * Authors: Beomyoung Kim, YoungJoon Yoo, Chae Eun Rhee, Junmo Kim
    * Abstract: Weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) has been considered as a more challenging task than weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Compared to WSSS, WSIS requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to extract from image-level labels. To tackle the problem, most WSIS approaches use off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance or object level labels, deviating the fundamental definition of the fully-image-level supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach including two innovative components. First, we propose a semantic knowledge transfer to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf proposals. Second, we propose a self-refinement method to refine the pseudo instance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for training in an online manner. Here, we discover an erroneous phenomenon, semantic drift, that occurred by the missing instances in pseudo instance labels categorized as background class. This semantic drift occurs confusion between background and instance in training and consequently degrades the segmentation performance. We term this problem as semantic drift problem and show that our proposed self-refinement method eliminates the semantic drift problem. The extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve a considerable performance without off-the-shelf proposal techniques.

Whereas previous methods pre-compute handcrafted features that relate the mesh and the skeleton or assume a fixed topology of the skeleton, the proposed method extracts this information in an end-to-end learnable fashion by jointly learning the best relationship between mesh vertices and skeleton joints. The proposed method exploits the benefits of the novel Multi-Aggregator Graph Convolution that combines the results of different aggregators during the summarizing step of the Message-Passing scheme, helping the operation to generalize for unseen topologies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the contributions of our novel architecture, with SkinningNet outperforming current state-of-the-art alternatives.

    * Abstract: Open-world instance segmentation is the task of grouping pixels into object instances without any pre-determined taxonomy. This is challenging, as state-of-the-art methods rely on explicit class semantics obtained from large labeled datasets, and out-of-domain evaluation performance drops significantly. Here we propose a novel approach for mask proposals, Generic Grouping Networks (GGNs), constructed without semantic supervision. Our approach combines a local measure of pixel affinity with instance-level mask supervision, producing a training regimen designed to make the model as generic as the data diversity allows. We introduce a method for predicting Pairwise Affinities (PA), a learned local relationship between pairs of pixels. PA generalizes very well to unseen categories. From PA we construct a large set of pseudo-ground-truth instance masks; combined with human-annotated instance masks we train GGNs and significantly outperform the SOTA on open-world instance segmentation on various benchmarks including COCO, LVIS, ADE20K, and UVO.

    * Abstract: Automated microscopy image analysis is a fundamental step for digital pathology and computer aided diagnosis. Most existing deep learning methods typically require postprocessing to achieve instance segmentation and are computationally expensive when directly used with 3D microscopy volumes. Supervised learning methods generally need large amounts of ground truth annotations for training whereas manually annotating ground truth masks is laborious especially for a 3D volume. To address these issues, we propose an ensemble learning and slice fusion strategy for 3D nuclei instance segmentation that we call Ensemble Mask R-CNN (EMR-CNN) which uses different object detectors to generate nuclei segmentation masks for each 2D slice of a volume and propose a 2D ensemble fusion and a 2D to 3D slice fusion to merge these 2D segmentation masks into a 3D segmentation mask. Our method does not need any ground truth annotations for training and can inference on any large size volumes. Our proposed method was tested on a variety of microscopy volumes collected from multiple regions of organ tissues. The execution time and robustness analyses show that our method is practical and effective.

    * Authors: Giacomo Nebbia, Adriana Kovashka
    * Abstract: A common paradigm in deep learning applications for computer vision is self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning on a target task. In the self-supervision step, a model is trained in a supervised fashion, but the source of supervision needs to be implicitly defined by the data. Image-caption alignment is often used as such a source of implicit supervision in multimodal pretraining, and grounding (i.e., matching word tokens with visual tokens) is one way to exploit it. We introduce a strategy to take advantage of an underexplored structure in image-caption datasets: the relationship between captions matched with different images but mentioning the same objects. Given an image-caption pair, we find an additional caption that mentions one of the objects the first caption mentions, and we impose a sparse grounding between the image and the second caption so that only a few word tokens are grounded with the image. Our goal is to learn a better feature representation for the objects mentioned by both captions, encouraging grounding between the additional caption and the image to focus on the common objects only. We report superior grounding performance when comparing our approach with a previously-published pretraining strategy, and we show the benefit of our proposed double-caption grounding on two downstream detection tasks: supervised detection and open-vocabulary detection.

    * Abstract: We propose Video Localized Narratives, a new form of multimodal video annotations connecting vision and language. In the original Localized Narratives, annotators speak and move their mouse simultaneously on an image, thus grounding each word with a mouse trace segment. However, this is challenging on a video. Our new protocol empowers annotators to tell the story of a video with Localized Narratives, capturing even complex events involving multiple actors interacting with each other and with several passive objects. We annotated 20k videos of the OVIS, UVO, and Oops datasets, totalling 1.7M words. Based on this data, we also construct new benchmarks for the video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks, and provide reference results from strong baseline models. Our annotations are available at https://google.github.io/video-localized-narratives/.

    * Authors: Qiaoqiao Wei, Hui Zhang, Jun-Hai Yong
    * Abstract: Interactive image segmentation aims at obtaining a segmentation mask for an image using simple user annotations. During each round of interaction, the segmentation result from the previous round serves as feedback to guide the user's annotation and provides dense prior information for the segmentation model, effectively acting as a bridge between interactions. Existing methods overlook the importance of feedback or simply concatenate it with the original input, leading to underutilization of feedback and an increase in the number of required annotations. To address this, we propose an approach called Focused and Collaborative Feedback Integration (FCFI) to fully exploit the feedback for click-based interactive image segmentation. FCFI first focuses on a local area around the new click and corrects the feedback based on the similarities of high-level features. It then alternately and collaboratively updates the feedback and deep features to integrate the feedback into the features. The efficacy and efficiency of FCFI were validated on four benchmarks, namely GrabCut, Berkeley, SBD, and DAVIS. Experimental results show that FCFI achieved new state-of-the-art performance with less computational overhead than previous methods.

    * Abstract: Neural implicit surface representation methods show impressive reconstruction results but struggle to handle texture-less planar regions that widely exist in indoor scenes. Existing approaches addressing this leverage image prior that requires assistive networks trained with large-scale annotated datasets. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised super-plane constraint by exploring the free geometry cues from the predicted surface, which can further regularize the reconstruction of plane regions without any other ground truth annotations. Specifically, we introduce an iterative training scheme, where (i) grouping of pixels to formulate a super-plane (analogous to super-pixels), and (ii) optimizing of the scene reconstruction network via a super-plane constraint, are progressively conducted. We demonstrate that the model trained with super-planes surprisingly outperforms the one using conventional annotated planes, as individual super-plane statistically occupies a larger area and leads to more stable training. Extensive experiments show that our self-supervised super-plane constraint significantly improves 3D reconstruction quality even better than using ground truth plane segmentation. Additionally, the plane reconstruction results from our model can be used for auto-labeling for other vision tasks. The code and models are available at https: //github.com/botaoye/S3PRecon.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the rotation averaging problem applied in global Structure-from-Motion pipelines. We argue that the main problem of current methods is the minimized cost function that is only weakly connected with the input data via the estimated epipolar geometries. We propose to better model the underlying noise distributions by directly propagating the uncertainty from the point correspondences into the rotation averaging. Such uncertainties are obtained for free by considering the Jacobians of two-view refinements. Moreover, we explore integrating a variant of the MAGSAC loss into the rotation averaging problem, instead of using classical robust losses employed in current frameworks. The proposed method leads to results superior to baselines, in terms of accuracy, on large-scale public benchmarks. The code is public. https://github.com/zhangganlin/GlobalSfMpy

    * Abstract: What is a rose, visually? A rose comprises its intrinsics, including the distribution of geometry, texture, and material specific to its object category. With knowledge of these intrinsic properties, we may render roses of different sizes and shapes, in different poses, and under different lighting conditions. In this work, we build a generative model that learns to capture such object intrinsics from a single image, such as a photo of a bouquet. Such an image includes multiple instances of an object type. These instances all share the same intrinsics, but appear different due to a combination of variance within these intrinsics and differences in extrinsic factors, such as pose and illumination. Experiments show that our model successfully learns object intrinsics (distribution of geometry, texture, and material) for a wide range of objects, each from a single Internet image. Our method achieves superior results on multiple downstream tasks, including intrinsic image decomposition, shape and image generation, view synthesis, and relighting.

    * Abstract: Researchers typically investigate neural network representations by examining activation outputs for one or more layers of a network. Here, we investigate the potential for ReLU activation patterns (encoded as bit vectors) to aid in understanding and interpreting the behavior of neural networks. We utilize Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) to investigate the coherence of data within the embedding spaces of a deep neural network. From each layer of a network, we extract and utilize bit vectors to construct similarity scores between images. From these similarity scores, we build a similarity matrix for a collection of images drawn from 2 classes. We then apply Fiedler partitioning to the associated Laplacian matrix to separate the classes. Our results indicate, through bit vector representations, that the network continues to refine class detectability with the last ReLU layer achieving better than 95% separation accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that bit vectors aid in adversarial image detection, again achieving over 95% accuracy in separating adversarial and non-adversarial images using a simple classifier.

    * Abstract: Despite significant advances in image anomaly detection and segmentation, few methods use 3D information. We utilize a recently introduced 3D anomaly detection dataset to evaluate whether or not using 3D information is a lost opportunity. First, we present a surprising finding: standard color-only methods outperform all current methods that are explicitly designed to exploit 3D information. This is counter-intuitive as even a simple inspection of the dataset shows that color-only methods are insufficient for images containing geometric anomalies. This motivates the question: how can anomaly detection methods effectively use 3D information? We investigate a range of shape representations including hand-crafted and deep-learning-based; we demonstrate that rotation invariance plays the leading role in the performance. We uncover a simple 3D-only method that beats all recent approaches while not using deep learning, external pre-training datasets, or color information. As the 3D-only method cannot detect color and texture anomalies, we combine it with color-based features, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art. Our method, dubbed BTF (Back to the Feature) achieves pixel-wise ROCAUC: 99.3% and PRO: 96.4% on MVTec 3D-AD.

    * Abstract: Superpixels play a crucial role in image processing by partitioning an image into clusters of pixels with similar visual attributes. This facilitates subsequent image processing tasks offering computational advantages over the manipulation of individual pixels. While numerous oversegmentation techniques have emerged in recent years many rely on predefined initialization and termination criteria. In this paper a novel top-down superpixel segmentation algorithm called Hierarchical Histogram Threshold Segmentation (HHTS) is introduced. It eliminates the need for initialization and implements auto-termination outperforming state-of-the-art methods w.r.t boundary recall. This is achieved by iteratively partitioning individual pixel segments into foreground and background and applying intensity thresholding across multiple color channels. The underlying iterative process constructs a superpixel hierarchy that adapts to local detail distributions until color information exhaustion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of boundary adherence while maintaining competitive runtime performance on the BSDS500 and NYUV2 datasets. Furthermore an application of HHTS in refining machine learning-based semantic segmentation masks produced by the Segment Anything Foundation Model (SAM) is presented.

    * Abstract: Many existing motion prediction approaches rely on symbolic perception outputs to generate agent trajectories such as bounding boxes road graph information and traffic lights. This symbolic representation is a high-level abstraction of the real world which may render the motion prediction model vulnerable to perception errors (e.g. failures in detecting open-vocabulary obstacles) while missing salient information from the scene context (e.g. poor road conditions). An alternative paradigm is end-to-end learning from raw sensors. However this approach suffers from the lack of interpretability and requires significantly more training resources. In this work we propose tokenizing the visual world into a compact set of scene elements and then leveraging pre-trained image foundation models and LiDAR neural networks to encode all the scene elements in an open-vocabulary manner. The image foundation model enables our scene tokens to encode the general knowledge of the open world while the LiDAR neural network encodes geometry information. Our proposed representation can efficiently encode the multi-frame multi-modality observations with a few hundred tokens and is compatible with most transformer-based architectures. To evaluate our method we have augmented Waymo Open Motion Dataset with camera embeddings. Experiments over Waymo Open Motion Dataset show that our approach leads to significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art.

    * Abstract: Annotating lots of 3D medical images for training segmentation models is time-consuming. The goal of weakly supervised semantic segmentation is to train segmentation models without using any ground truth segmentation masks. Our work addresses the case where only image-level categorical labels indicating the presence or absence of a particular region of interest (such as tumours or lesions) are available. Most existing methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM). We propose a novel approach ToNNO which is based on the Tomographic reconstruction of a Neural Network's Output. Our technique extracts stacks of slices with different angles from the input 3D volume feeds these slices to a 2D encoder and applies the inverse Radon transform in order to reconstruct a 3D heatmap of the encoder's predictions. This generic method allows to perform dense prediction tasks on 3D volumes using any 2D image encoder. We apply it to weakly supervised medical image segmentation by training the 2D encoder to output high values for slices containing the regions of interest. We test it on four large scale medical image datasets and outperform 2D CAM methods. We then extend ToNNO by combining tomographic reconstruction with CAM methods proposing Averaged CAM and Tomographic CAM which obtain even better results.

    * Abstract: Vision foundation models have been explored recently to build general-purpose vision systems. However predominant paradigms driven by casting instance-level tasks as an object-word alignment bring heavy cross-modality interaction which is not effective in prompting object detection and visual grounding. Another line of work that focuses on pixel-level tasks often encounters a large annotation gap of things and stuff and suffers from mutual interference between foreground-object and background-class segmentation. In stark contrast to the prevailing methods we present APE a universal visual perception model for aligning and prompting everything all at once in an image to perform diverse tasks i.e. detection segmentation and grounding as an instance-level sentence-object matching paradigm. Specifically APE advances the convergence of detection and grounding by reformulating language-guided grounding as open-vocabulary detection which efficiently scales up model prompting to thousands of category vocabularies and region descriptions while maintaining the effectiveness of cross-modality fusion. To bridge the granularity gap of different pixel-level tasks APE equalizes semantic and panoptic segmentation to proxy instance learning by considering any isolated regions as individual instances. APE aligns vision and language representation on broad data with natural and challenging characteristics all at once without task-specific fine-tuning. The extensive experiments on over 160 datasets demonstrate that with only one-suit of weights APE outperforms (or is on par with) the state-of-the-art models proving that an effective yet universal perception for anything aligning and prompting is indeed feasible.

    * Abstract: 3D city generation is a desirable yet challenging task since humans are more sensitive to structural distortions in urban environments. Additionally generating 3D cities is more complex than 3D natural scenes since buildings as objects of the same class exhibit a wider range of appearances compared to the relatively consistent appearance of objects like trees in natural scenes. To address these challenges we propose CityDreamer a compositional generative model designed specifically for unbounded 3D cities. Our key insight is that 3D city generation should be a composition of different types of neural fields: 1) various building instances and 2) background stuff such as roads and green lands. Specifically we adopt the bird's eye view scene representation and employ a volumetric render for both instance-oriented and stuff-oriented neural fields. The generative hash grid and periodic positional embedding are tailored as scene parameterization to suit the distinct characteristics of building instances and background stuff. Furthermore we contribute a suite of CityGen Datasets including OSM and GoogleEarth which comprises a vast amount of real-world city imagery to enhance the realism of the generated 3D cities both in their layouts and appearances. CityDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in generating realistic 3D cities but also in localized editing within the generated cities.

    * Abstract: Conventional image outpainting methods usually treat unobserved areas as unknown and extend the scene only in terms of semantic consistency thus overlooking the hidden information in shadows cast by unobserved areas such as the invisible shapes and semantics. In this paper we propose to extract and utilize the hidden information of unobserved areas from their shadows to enhance image outpainting. To this end we propose an end-to-end deep approach that explicitly looks into the shadows within the image. Specifically we extract shadows from the input image and identify instance-level shadow regions cast by the unobserved areas. Then the instance-level shadow representations are concatenated to predict the scene layout of each unobserved instance and outpaint the unobserved areas. Finally two discriminators are implemented to enhance alignment between the extended semantics and their shadows. In the experiments we show that our proposed approach provides complementary cues for outpainting and achieves considerable improvement on all datasets by adopting our approach as a plug-in module.

    * Authors: Jinzhi Zheng, Heng Fan, Libo Zhang
    * Abstract: Segmentation-based scene text detection algorithms that are accurate to the pixel level can satisfy the detection of arbitrary shape scene text and have received widespread attention. On the one hand due to the complexity and diversity of the scene text the convolution with a fixed kernel size has some limitations in extracting the visual features of the scene text. On the other hand most of the existing segmentation-based algorithms only segment the center of the text losing information such as the edges and directions of the text with limited detection accuracy. There are also some improved algorithms that use iterative corrections or introduce other multiple information to improve text detection accuracy but at the expense of efficiency. To address these issues this paper proposes a simple and effective scene text detection method the Kernel Adaptive Convolution which is designed with a Kernel Adaptive Convolution Module for scene text detection via predicting the distance map. Specifically first we design an extensible kernel adaptive convolution module (KACM) to extract visual features from multiple convolutions with different kernel sizes in an adaptive manner. Secondly our method predicts the text distance map under the supervision of a priori information (including direction map and foreground segmentation map) and completes the text detection from the predicted distance map. Experiments on four publicly available datasets prove the effectiveness of our algorithm in which the accuracy and efficiency of both the Total-Text and TD500 outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm. The algorithm efficiency is improved while the accuracy is competitive on ArT and CTW1500.

    * Abstract: The deep generative adversarial networks (GAN) recently have been shown to be promising for different computer vision applications, like image editing, synthesizing high resolution images, generating videos, etc. These networks and the corresponding learning scheme can handle various visual space mappings. We approach GANs with a novel training method and learning objective, to discover multiple object instances for three cases: 1) synthesizing a picture of a specific object within a cluttered scene; 2) localizing different categories in images for weakly supervised object detection; and 3) improving object discovery in object detection pipelines. A crucial advantage of our method is that it learns a new deep similarity metric, to distinguish multiple objects in one image. We demonstrate that the network can act as an encoder-decoder generating parts of an image which contain an object, or as a modified deep CNN to represent images for object detection in supervised and weakly supervised scheme. Our ranking GAN offers a novel way to search through images for object specific patterns. We have conducted experiments for different scenarios and demonstrate the method performance for object synthesizing and weakly supervised object detection and classification using the MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets.

    * Abstract: Acquiring high-resolution images in the field for image-based crop phenotyping is typically performed by complicated, custom built "pheno-mobiles." In this paper, we demonstrate that large datasets of crop row images can be easily acquired with consumer cameras attached to a regular tractor. Localization and labeling of individual rows of plants are performed by a computer vision approach, rather than sophisticated real-time geo-location hardware on the tractor. We evaluate our approach for cropping rows of early-season plants from a Brassica carinata field trial where we achieve 100% recall and 99% precision. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept plant counting method for our ProTractor system using an object detection network that achieves a mean average precision of 0.82 when detecting plants, and an R2 of 0.89 when counting plants. The ProTractor design and software are open source to advance the collection of large outdoor plant phenotyping datasets with inexpensive and easy to use acquisition systems.

    * Abstract: Neural networks for semantic segmentation can be seen as statistical models that provide for each pixel of one image a probability distribution on predefined classes. The predicted class is then usually obtained by the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) which is known as Bayes rule in decision theory. From decision theory we also know that the Bayes rule is optimal regarding the simple symmetric cost function. Therefore, it weights each type of confusion between two different classes equally, e.g., given images of urban street scenes there is no distinction in the cost function if the network confuses a person with a street or a building with a tree. Intuitively, there might be confusions of classes that are more important to avoid than others. In this work, we want to raise awareness of the possibility of explicitly defining confusion costs and the associated ethical difficulties if it comes down to providing numbers. We define two cost functions from different extreme perspectives, an egoistic and an altruistic one, and show how safety relevant quantities like precision / recall and (segment-wise) false positive / negative rate change when interpolating between MAP, egoistic and altruistic decision rules.

    * Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of street scenes the reliability of the prediction and therefore uncertainty measures are of highest interest. We present a method that generates for each input image a hierarchy of nested crops around the image center and presents these, all re-scaled to the same size, to a neural network for semantic segmentation. The resulting softmax outputs are then post processed such that we can investigate mean and variance over all image crops as well as mean and variance of uncertainty heat maps obtained from pixel-wise uncertainty measures, like the entropy, applied to each crop's softmax output. In our tests, we use the publicly available DeepLabv3+ MobilenetV2 network (trained on the Cityscapes dataset) and demonstrate that the incorporation of crops improves the quality of the prediction and that we obtain more reliable uncertainty measures. These are then aggregated over predicted segments for either classifying between IoU=0 and IoU>0 (meta classification) or predicting the IoU via linear regression (meta regression). The latter yields reliable performance estimates for segmentation networks, in particular useful in the absence of ground truth. For the task of meta classification we obtain a classification accuracy of 81.93% and an AUROC of 89.89%. For meta regression we obtain an R2 value of 84.77%. These results yield significant improvements compared to other approaches.

    * Authors: Changlin Li, Taojiannan Yang, Sijie Zhu, Chen Chen, Shanyue Guan
    * Abstract: Object detection in high-resolution aerial images is a challenging problem because of 1) the large variation in object size, and 2) non-uniform distribution of objects. A common solution is to divide the large aerial image into small (uniform) chips and then apply object detection on each small crop. In this paper, we investigate the effective image cropping strategy to address these challenges. Specifically, we propose a Density-Map guided object detection Network (DMNet), which is inspired from the observation that density map presents how objects distribute in terms of pixel intensity. As pixel intensity varies, it is able to tell whether a region has objects or not, which in turn provide guidance to crop image statistically. DMNet has three key components: a density map generation module, an image cropping module and an object detector. DMNet generates density map and learns scale of categories by utilizing pixel intensity as the guidance to form an implicit boundary as tentative cropping region, which is affected by objects in the region. Compared with ClusDet [??], DMNet puts more emphasis on spatial relation between objects. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular aerial image datasets, i.e. VisionDrone [??] and UAVDT [??].

    * Abstract: We present a new visual parsing method based on convolutional neural networks for handwritten mathematical formulas. The Query-Driven Global Graph Attention (QDGGA) parsing model employs multi-task learning, and uses a single feature representation for locating, classifying, and relating symbols. First, a Line-Of-Sight (LOS) graph is computed over the handwritten strokes in a formula. Second, class distributions for LOS nodes and edges are obtained using query-specific feature filters (i.e., attention) in a single feed-forward pass. Finally, a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) is extracted from the weighted graph. Our preliminary results show that this is a promising new approach for visual parsing of handwritten formulas. Our data and source code are publicly available.

    * Abstract: This papers focuses on symbol spotting on real-world digital architectural floor plans with a deep learning (DL)-based framework. Traditional on-the-fly symbol spotting methods are unable to address the semantic challenge of graphical notation variability, i.e. low intra-class symbol similarity, an issue that is particularly important in architectural floor plan analysis. The presence of occlusion and clutter, characteristic of real-world plans, along with a varying graphical symbol complexity from almost trivial to highly complex, also pose challenges to existing spotting methods. In this paper, we address all of the above issues by leveraging recent advances in DL and adapting an object detection framework based on the You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture. We propose a training strategy based on tiles, avoiding many issues particular to DL-based object detection networks related to the relative small size of symbols compared to entire floor plans, aspect ratios, and data augmentation. Experiments on real-world floor plans demonstrate that our method successfully detects architectural symbols with low intra-class similarity and of variable graphical complexity, even in the presence of heavy occlusion and clutter. Additional experiments on the public SESYD dataset confirm that our proposed approach can deal with various degradation and noise levels and outperforms other symbol spotting methods.

    * Abstract: Skeleton is a winter sport where performance is greatly affected by the velocity an athlete can achieve during their start up to the point where they load themselves onto their sled. As such, it is of interest to athletes and coaching staff to be able to monitor the performance of their athletes and how they respond to different training schedules and techniques. This paper proposes a non-invasive vision based method for measuring the velocity of a skeleton athlete and their sled during the push start. Mean differences in estimated velocity between ground truth data and our proposed system were -0.005 (+/- 0.186) m/s for the athlete mass centre and -0.017 (+/- 0.133) m/s for the sled. The results compare favourably to techniques previously presented in the biomechanics and sport science literature.

    * Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to detect groups in ego-vision scenarios. People in the scene are tracked through the video sequence and their head pose and 3D location are estimated. Based on the concept of f-formation, we define with the orientation and distance an inherently social pairwise feature that describes the affinity of a pair of people in the scene. We apply a correlation clustering algorithm that merges pairs of people into socially related groups. Due to the very shifting nature of social interactions and the different meanings that orientations and distances can assume in different contexts, we learn the weight vector of the correlation clustering using Structural SVMs. We extensively test our approach on two publicly available datasets showing encouraging results when detecting groups from first-person camera views.

    * Abstract: This work describes and explores novel steps towards activity recognition from an egocentric point of view. Activity recognition is a broadly studied topic in computer vision, but the unique characteristics of wearable vision systems present new challenges and opportunities. We evaluate a challenging new publicly available dataset that includes trajectories of different users across two indoor environments performing a set of more than 20 different activities. The visual features studied include compact and global image descriptors, including GIST and a novel skin segmentation based histogram signature, and state-of-the art image representations for recognition, including Bag of SIFT words and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based features. Our experiments show that simple and compact features provide reasonable accuracy to obtain basic activity information (in our case, manipulation vs. non-manipulation). However, for finer grained categories CNN-based features provide the most promising results. Future steps include integration of depth information with these features and temporal consistency into the pipeline.

    * Abstract: We develop an approach for detection of ruins of livestock enclosures in alpine areas captured by high-resolution remotely sensed images. These structures are usually of approximately rectangular shape and appear in images as faint fragmented contours in complex background. We address this problem by introducing a new rectangularity feature that quantifies the degree of alignment of an optimal subset of extracted linear segments with a contour of rectangular shape. The rectangularity feature has high values not only for perfect enclosures, but also for broken ones with distorted angles, fragmented walls, or even a completely missing wall. However, it has zero value for spurious structures with less than three sides of a perceivable rectangle. Performance analysis using large imagery of an alpine environment is provided. We show how the detection performance can be improved by learning from only a few representative examples and a large number of negatives.

    * Abstract: We describe PhotoOCR, a system for text extraction from images. Our particular focus is reliable text extraction from smartphone imagery, with the goal of text recognition as a user input modality similar to speech recognition. Commercially available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning has substantially improved isolated character classification; we build on this progress by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate modern datacenter-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency; mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google Translate for Android.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach for text localization in natural images, by discriminating text and non-text regions at three levels: pixel, component and textline levels. Firstly, a powerful low-level filter called the Stroke Feature Transform (SFT) is proposed, which extends the widely-used Stroke Width Transform (SWT) by incorporating color cues of text pixels, leading to significantly enhanced performance on inter-component separation and intra-component connection. Secondly, based on the output of SFT, we apply two classifiers, a text component classifier and a text-line classifier, sequentially to extract text regions, eliminating the heuristic procedures that are commonly used in previous approaches. The two classifiers are built upon two novel Text Covariance Descriptors (TCDs) that encode both the heuristic properties and the statistical characteristics of text stokes. Finally, text regions are located by simply thresholding the text-line confident map. Our method was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: ICDAR 2005 and ICDAR 2011, and the corresponding Fmeasure values are 0.72 and 0.73, respectively, surpassing previous methods in accuracy by a large margin.

    * Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful shape regularity that's been exploited by perceptual grouping researchers in both human and computer vision to recover part structure from an image without a priori knowledge of scene content. Drawing on the concept of a medial axis, defined as the locus of centers of maximal inscribed discs that sweep out a symmetric part, we model part recovery as the search for a sequence of deformable maximal inscribed disc hypotheses generated from a multiscale superpixel segmentation, a framework proposed by [13]. However, we learn affinities between adjacent superpixels in a space that's invariant to bending and tapering along the symmetry axis, enabling us to capture a wider class of symmetric parts. Moreover, we introduce a global cost that perceptually integrates the hypothesis space by combining a pairwise and a higher-level smoothing term, which we minimize globally using dynamic programming. The new framework is demonstrated on two datasets, and is shown to significantly outperform the baseline [13].

    * Authors: Engin Turetken, Carlos Becker, Przemyslaw Glowacki, Fethallah Benmansour, Pascal Fua
    * Abstract: We propose a new approach to detecting irregular curvilinear structures in noisy image stacks. In contrast to earlier approaches that rely on circular models of the crosssections, ours allows for the arbitrarily-shaped ones that are prevalent in biological imagery. This is achieved by maximizing the image gradient flux along multiple directions and radii, instead of only two with a unique radius as is usually done. This yields a more complex optimization problem for which we propose a computationally efficient solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of challenging gray scale and color datasets and show that it outperforms existing techniques, especially on very irregular structures.

    * Abstract: Our goal is to estimate contour flow (the contour pairs with consistent point correspondence) from inconsistent contours extracted independently in two video frames. We formulate the contour flow estimation locally as a motion segmentation problem where motion patterns grouped from optical flow field are exploited for local correspondence measurement. To solve local ambiguities, contour flow estimation is further formulated globally as a contour alignment problem. We propose a novel two-staged strategy to obtain global consistent point correspondence under various contour transitions such as splitting, merging and branching. The goal of the first stage is to obtain possible accurate contour-to-contour alignments, and the second stage aims to make a consistent fusion of many partial alignments. Such a strategy can properly balance the accuracy and the consistency, which enables a middle-level motion representation to be constructed by just concatenating frame-by-frame contour flow estimation. Experiments prove the effectiveness of our method.

    * Abstract: Deep neural network architectures have recently produced excellent results in a variety of areas in artificial intelligence and visual recognition, well surpassing traditional shallow architectures trained using hand-designed features. The power of deep networks stems both from their ability to perform local computations followed by pointwise non-linearities over increasingly larger receptive fields, and from the simplicity and scalability of the gradient-descent training procedure based on backpropagation. An open problem is the inclusion of layers that perform global, structured matrix computations like segmentation (e.g. normalized cuts) or higher-order pooling (e.g. log-tangent space metrics defined over the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices) while preserving the validity and efficiency of an end-to-end deep training framework. In this paper we propose a sound mathematical apparatus to formally integrate global structured computation into deep computation architectures. At the heart of our methodology is the development of the theory and practice of backpropagation that generalizes to the calculus of adjoint matrix variations. We perform segmentation experiments using the BSDS and MSCOCO benchmarks and demonstrate that deep networks relying on second-order pooling and normalized cuts layers, trained end-to-end using matrix backpropagation, outperform counterparts that do not take advantage of such global layers.

    * Abstract: In recent years, region proposals have replaced sliding windows in support of object recognition, offering more discriminating shape and appearance information through improved localization. One powerful approach for generating region proposals is based on minimizing parametric energy functions with parametric maxflow. In this paper, we introduce Parametric Min-Loss (PML), a novel structured learning framework for parametric energy functions. While PML is generally applicable to different domains, we use it in the context of region proposals to learn to combine a set of mid-level grouping cues to yield a small set of object region proposals with high recall. Our learning framework accounts for multiple diverse outputs, and is complemented by diversification seeds based on image location and color. This approach casts perceptual grouping and cue combination in a novel structured learning framework which yields baseline improvements on VOC 2012 and COCO 2014.

    * Abstract: The baselines of a document page are a set of virtual horizontal and parallel lines, to which the printed contents of document, e.g., text lines, tables or inserted photos, are aligned. Accurate baseline extraction is of great importance in the geometric correction of curved document images. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for accurate extraction of these virtual visual cues from a curved document image. Our method comes from two basic observations that the baselines of documents do not intersect with each other and that within a narrow strip, the baselines can be well approximated by linear segments. Based upon these observations, we propose a curvilinear projection based method and model the estimation of curved baselines as a constrained sequential optimization problem. A dynamic programming algorithm is then developed to efficiently solve the problem. The proposed method can extract the complete baselines through each pixel of document images in a high accuracy. It is also scripts insensitive and highly robust to image noises, non-textual objects, image resolutions and image quality degradation like blurring and non-uniform illumination. Extensive experiments on a number of captured document images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: Detecting highly articulated objects such as humans is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel part-based model built upon poselets, a notion of parts, and Markov Random Field (MRF) for modelling the human body structure under the variation of human poses and viewpoints. The problem of human detection is then formulated as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in the MRF model. Variational mean field method, a robust statistical inference, is adopted to approximate the MAP estimation. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with existing methods on different test sets including H3D and PASCAL VOC 2007-2009. Experimental results have favourbly shown the robustness of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art.

    * Abstract: Many existing approaches for image-to-geometry registration assume that either a textured 3D model or a good initial guess of the 3D pose is available to bootstrap the registration process. In this paper we consider the registration of photographs to 3D models even when no texture information is available. This is very challenging as we cannot rely on texture gradients, and even shading gradients are hard to estimate since the lighting conditions are unknown. To that end, we propose average shading gradients, a rendering technique that estimates the average gradient magnitude over all lighting directions under Lambertian shading. We use this gradient representation as the building block of a registration pipeline based on matching sparse features. To cope with inevitable false matches due to the missing texture information and to increase robustness, the pose of the 3D model is estimated in two stages. Coarse pose hypotheses are first obtained from a single correct match each, subsequently refined using SIFT flow, and finally verified. We apply our algorithm to registering images of real-world objects to untextured 3D meshes of limited accuracy.

    * Abstract: We address the problem of automatic extraction of foreground objects from videos. The goal is to provide a method for unsupervised collection of samples which can be further used for object detection training without any human intervention. We use the well known Selective Search approach to produce an initial still-image based segmentation of the video frames. This initial set of proposals is pruned and temporally extended using optical flow and transductive learning. Specifically, we propose to use Dense Trajectories in order to robustly match and track candidate boxes over different frames. The obtained box tracks are used to collect samples for unsupervised training of track-specific detectors. Finally, the detectors are run on the videos to extract the final tubes. The combination of appearance-based static ''objectness'' (Selective Search), motion information (Dense Trajectories) and transductive learning (detectors are forced to "overfit" on the unsupervised data used for training) makes the proposed approach extremely robust. We outperform state-of-the-art systems by a large margin on common benchmarks used for tube proposal evaluation.

To do so, we make use of a recently developed fine-grained taxonomy of human-object grasps. We introduce a large dataset of 12000 RGB-D images covering 71 everyday grasps in natural interactions. Our dataset is different from past work (typically addressed from a robotics perspective) in terms of its scale, diversity, and combination of RGB and depth data. From a computer-vision perspective, our dataset allows for exploration of contact and force prediction (crucial concepts in functional grasp analysis) from perceptual cues. We present extensive experimental results with state-of-the-art baselines, illustrating the role of segmentation, object context, and 3D-understanding in functional grasp analysis. We demonstrate a near 2X improvement over prior work and a naive deep baseline, while pointing out important directions for improvement.

    * Abstract: We propose an online tracking algorithm that adaptively models target appearances based on an online gradient boosting decision tree. Our algorithm is particularly useful for non-rigid and/or articulated objects since it handles various deformations of the target effectively by integrating a classifier operating on individual patches and provides segmentation masks of the target as final results. The posterior of the target state is propagated over time by particle filtering, where the likelihood is computed based mainly on patch-level confidence map associated with a latent target state corresponding to each sample. Once tracking is completed in each frame, our gradient boosting decision tree is updated to adapt new data in a recursive manner. For effective evaluation of segmentation-based tracking algorithms, we construct a new ground-truth that contains pixel-level annotation of segmentation mask. We evaluate the performance of our tracking algorithm based on the measures for segmentation masks, where our algorithm illustrates superior accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art segmentation-based tracking methods.

    * Abstract: The prevalent scene text detection approach follows four sequential steps comprising character candidate detection, false character candidate removal, text line extraction, and text line verification. However, errors occur and accumulate throughout each of these sequential steps which often lead to low detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a unified scene text detection system, namely Text Flow, by utilizing the minimum cost (min-cost) flow network model. With character candidates detected by cascade boosting, the min-cost flow network model integrates the last three sequential steps into a single process which solves the error accumulation problem at both character level and text line level effectively. The proposed technique has been tested on three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset and a multilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on the multilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for the detection of texts in different languages.

    * Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of converting a rasterized floorplan image into a vector-graphics representation. Unlike existing approaches that rely on a sequence of low-level image processing heuristics, we adopt a learning-based approach. A neural architecture first transforms a rasterized image to a set of junctions that represent low-level geometric and semantic information (e.g., wall corners or door end-points). Integer programming is then formulated to aggregate junctions into a set of simple primitives (e.g., wall lines, door lines, or icon boxes) to produce a vectorized floorplan, while ensuring a topologically and geometrically consistent result. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves around 90% precision and recall, getting to the range of production-ready performance. The vector representation allows 3D model popup for better indoor scene visualization, direct model manipulation for architectural remodeling, and further computational applications such as data analysis. Our system is efficient: we have converted hundred thousand production-level floorplan images into the vector representation and generated 3D popup models.

    * Abstract: We propose 'Hide-and-Seek', a weakly-supervised framework that aims to improve object localization in images and action localization in videos. Most existing weakly-supervised methods localize only the most discriminative parts of an object rather than all relevant parts, which leads to suboptimal performance. Our key idea is to hide patches in a training image randomly, forcing the network to seek other relevant parts when the most discriminative part is hidden. Our approach only needs to modify the input image and can work with any network designed for object localization. During testing, we do not need to hide any patches. Our Hide-and-Seek approach obtains superior performance compared to previous methods for weakly-supervised object localization on the ILSVRC dataset. We also demonstrate that our framework can be easily extended to weakly-supervised action localization.

    * Abstract: In this paper we propose a new salient object detection method via structured label prediction. By learning appearance features in rectangular regions, our structural region representation encodes the local saliency distribution with a matrix of binary labels. We show that the linear combination of structured labels can well model the saliency distribution in local regions. Representing region saliency with structured labels has two advantages: 1) it connects the label assignment of all enclosed pixels, which produces a smooth saliency prediction; and 2) regular-shaped nature of structured labels enables well definition of traditional cues such as regional properties and center surround contrast, and these cues help to build meaningful and informative saliency measures. To measure the consistency between a structured label and the corresponding saliency distribution, we further propose an adaptive label ranking algorithm using proposals that are generated by a CNN model. Finally, we introduce a K-NN enhanced graph representation for saliency propagation, which is more favorable for our task than the widely-used adjacent-graph-based ones. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on six popular benchmarks compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

We qualitatively and quantitatively compare the performance of our deep adversarial network with two other networks without adversarial losses. We show that our deep adversarial network performs better than the other two networks at segmenting the spheroids from our 2D bright-field microscopy images.

The classification results are then post-processed to estimate the exact location of the crop plant. Experimental evaluation is conducted to evaluate the method and the result achieved an overall precision and recall of 66% and 64%, respectively.

    * Abstract: Extracting meaningful phenotypes for temporal plant phenotyping analysis by considering individual parts of a plant, e.g., leaves and stem, using computer vision techniques remains a critical bottleneck due to constantly increasing complexity in plant architecture with variations in self-occlusions and phyllotaxy. The paper introduces an algorithm to compute stem angle for use as a measure of plants' susceptibility to lodging. It involves the identification of leaf-tips and leaf-junctions based on graph theoretic analysis. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated based on a public dataset called Panicoid Phenomap-1. A time-series clustering analysis is performed on stem angle values during vegetative stage life cycle of the maize plants. This analysis summarizes the temporal patterns of the stem angles into three main groups, and establishes that the temporal variation of the stem angles is likely to be regulated by genetic variation under similar environmental conditions.

    * Abstract: Automatic vectorization of fashion hand-drawn sketches is a crucial task performed by fashion industries to speed up their workflows. Performing vectorization on hand-drawn sketches is not an easy task, and it requires a first crucial step that consists in extracting precise and thin lines from sketches that are potentially very diverse (depending on the tool used and on the designer capabilities and preferences). This paper proposes a system for automatic vectorization of fashion hand-drawn sketches based on Pearson's Correlation Coefficient with multiple Gaussian kernels in order to enhance and extract curvilinear structures in a sketch. The use of correlation grants invariancy about image contrast and lighting, making the extracted lines more reliable for vectorization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been designed to equally extract both thin and wide lines with changing stroke hardness, which are common in fashion hand-drawn sketches. It also works for crossing lines, adjacent parallel lines and needs very few parameters (if any) to run. The efficacy of the proposal has been demonstrated on both hand-drawn sketches and images with added artificial noise, showing in both cases excellent performance w.r.t. the state of the art.

    * Abstract: A comprehensive semantic understanding of a scene is important for many applications - but in what space should diverse semantic information (e.g., objects, scene categories, material types, 3D shapes, etc.) be grounded and what should be its structure? Aspiring to have one unified structure that hosts diverse types of semantics, we follow the Scene Graph paradigm in 3D, generating a 3D Scene Graph. Given a 3D mesh and registered panoramic images, we construct a graph that spans the entire building and includes semantics on objects (e.g., class, material, shape and other attributes), rooms (e.g., function, illumination type, etc.) and cameras (e.g., location, etc.), as well as the relationships among these entities. However, this process is prohibitively labor heavy if done manually. To alleviate this we devise a semi-automatic framework that employs existing detection methods and enhances them using two main constraints: I. framing of query images sampled on panoramas to maximize the performance of 2D detectors, and II. multi-view consistency enforcement across 2D detections that originate in different camera locations.

However, these systems make predictions in 2D, ignoring the 3D structure of the world. Concurrently, advances in 3D shape prediction have mostly focused on synthetic benchmarks and isolated objects. We unify advances in these two areas. We propose a system that detects objects in real-world images and produces a triangle mesh giving the full 3D shape of each detected object. Our system, called Mesh R-CNN, augments Mask R-CNN with a mesh prediction branch that outputs meshes with varying topological structure by first predicting coarse voxel representations which are converted to meshes and refined with a graph convolution network operating over the mesh's vertices and edges. We validate our mesh prediction branch on ShapeNet, where we outperform prior work on single-image shape prediction. We then deploy our full Mesh R-CNN system on Pix3D, where we jointly detect objects and predict their 3D shapes.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection, an important step of scene text reading systems, has witnessed rapid development with convolutional neural networks. Nonetheless, two main challenges still exist and hamper its deployment to real-world applications. The first problem is the trade-off between speed and accuracy. The second one is to model the arbitrary-shaped text instance. Recently, some methods have been proposed to tackle arbitrary-shaped text detection, but they rarely take the speed of the entire pipeline into consideration, which may fall short in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate arbitrary-shaped text detector, termed Pixel Aggregation Network (PAN), which is equipped with a low computational-cost segmentation head and a learnable post-processing. More specifically, the segmentation head is made up of Feature Pyramid Enhancement Module (FPEM) and Feature Fusion Module (FFM). FPEM is a cascadable U-shaped module, which can introduce multi-level information to guide the better segmentation. FFM can gather the features given by the FPEMs of different depths into a final feature for segmentation. The learnable post-processing is implemented by Pixel Aggregation (PA), which can precisely aggregate text pixels by predicted similarity vectors. Experiments on several standard benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed PAN. It is worth noting that our method can achieve a competitive F-measure of 79.9% at 84.2 FPS on CTW1500.

    * Abstract: Outlier rejection and equivalently inlier set optimization is a key ingredient in numerous applications in computer vision such as filtering point-matches in camera pose estimation or plane and normal estimation in point clouds. Several approaches exist, yet at large scale we face a combinatorial explosion of possible solutions and state-of-the-art methods like RANSAC, Hough transform or Branch&Bound require a minimum inlier ratio or prior knowledge to remain practical. In fact, for problems such as camera posing in very large scenes these approaches become useless as they have exponential runtime growth if these conditions aren't met. To approach the problem we present a efficient and general algorithm for outlier rejection based on "intersecting" k-dimensional surfaces in Rd . We provide a recipe for casting a variety of geometric problems as finding a point in Rd which maximizes the number of nearby surfaces (and thus inliers). The resulting algorithm has linear worst-case complexity with a better runtime dependency in the approximation factor than competing algorithms while not requiring domain specific bounds. This is achieved by introducing a space decomposition scheme that bounds the number of computations by successively rounding and grouping samples. Our recipe (and open-source code) enables anybody to derive such fast approaches to new problems across a wide range of domains. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach on several camera posing problems with a high number of matches at low inlier ratio achieving state-of-the-art results at significantly lower processing times.

    * Abstract: The increasing availability of satellite and aerial imagery has sparked substantial interest in automatically updating street maps by processing aerial images. Until now, the community has largely focused on road extraction, where road networks are inferred from scratch from an aerial image. However, given that relatively high-quality maps exist in most parts of the world, in practice, inference approaches must be applied to update existing maps rather than infer new ones. With recent road extraction methods showing high accuracy, we argue that it is time to transition to the more practical map update task, where an existing map is updated by adding, removing, and shifting roads, without introducing errors in parts of the existing map that remain up-to-date. In this paper, we develop a new dataset called MUNO21 for the map update task, and show that it poses several new and interesting research challenges. We evaluate several state-of-the-art road extraction methods on MUNO21, and find that substantial further improvements in accuracy will be needed to realize automatic map update.

    * Abstract: With the recent progress in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), it is imperative for media and visual forensics to develop detectors which can identify and attribute images to the model generating them. Existing works have shown to attribute images to their corresponding GAN sources with high accuracy. However, these works are limited to a closed set scenario, failing to generalize to GANs unseen during train time and are therefore, not scalable with a steady influx of new GANs. We present an iterative algorithm for discovering images generated from previously unseen GANs by exploiting the fact that all GANs leave distinct fingerprints on their generated images. Our algorithm consists of multiple components including network training, out-of-distribution detection, clustering, merge and refine steps. Through extensive experiments, we show that our algorithm discovers unseen GANs with high accuracy and also generalizes to GANs trained on unseen real datasets. We additionally apply our algorithm to attribution and discovery of GANs in an online fashion as well as to the more standard task of real/fake detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to discover new GANs and can be used in an open-world setup.

    * Abstract: We present PrimitiveNet, a novel approach for high-resolution primitive instance segmentation from point clouds on a large scale. Our key idea is to transform the global segmentation problem into easier local tasks. We train a high-resolution primitive embedding network to predict explicit geometry features and implicit latent features for each point. The embedding is jointly trained with an adversarial network as a primitive discriminator to decide whether points are from the same primitive instance in local neighborhoods. Such local supervision encourages the learned embedding and discriminator to describe local surface properties and robustly distinguish different instances. At inference time, network predictions are followed by a region growing method to finalize the segmentation. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts based on mean average precision by a significant margin (46.3%) on ABC dataset [??]. We can process extremely large real scenes covering more than 0.1km^2. Ablation studies highlight the contribution of our core designs. Finally, our method can improve geometry processing algorithms to abstract scans as lightweight models.

    * Abstract: We propose the first learning-based approach for fast moving objects detection. Such objects are highly blurred and move over large distances within one video frame. Fast moving objects are associated with a deblurring and matting problem, also called deblatting. We show that the separation of deblatting into consecutive matting and deblurring allows achieving real-time performance, i.e. an order of magnitude speed-up, and thus enabling new classes of application. The proposed method detects fast moving objects as a truncated distance function to the trajectory by learning from synthetic data. For the sharp appearance estimation and accurate trajectory estimation, we propose a matting and fitting network that estimates the blurred appearance without background, followed by an energy minimization based deblurring. The state-of-the-art methods are outperformed in terms of recall, precision, trajectory estimation, and sharp appearance reconstruction. Compared to other methods, such as deblatting, the inference is of several orders of magnitude faster and allows applications such as real-time fast moving object detection and retrieval in large video collections.

    * Abstract: A table arranging data in rows and columns is a very effective data structure, which has been widely used in business and scientific research. Considering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis community. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a table as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition. Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on three popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made publicly available.

    * Abstract: The detection of polylines is usually either bound to branchless polylines or formulated in a recurrent way, prohibiting their use in real-time systems. We propose an approach that builds upon the idea of single shot object detection. Reformulating the problem of polyline detection as a bottom-up composition of small line segments allows to detect bounded, dashed and continuous polylines with a single head. This has several major advantages over previous methods. Not only is the method at 187 fps more than suited for real-time applications with virtually any restriction on the shapes of the detected polylines. By predicting multiple line segments for each cell, even branching or crossing polylines can be detected. We evaluate our approach on three different applications for road marking, lane border and center line detection. Hereby, we demonstrate the ability to generalize to different domains as well as both implicit and explicit polyline detection tasks.

    * Abstract: Shadows, motion parallax, and occlusions pose significant challenges to vision tasks in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) including object identification and tracking. Although there are many successful shadow detection approaches that work well in indoor scenes, close range outdoor scenes, and spaceborne satellite images, the methods tend to fail in intermediate altitude aerial WAMI. We propose an automatic shadow mask estimation approach for supervision without manual labeling to provide a large amount of training data for learning-based aerial shadow extraction. Analytical ground-truth shadow masks are generated using 3D point clouds combined with known solar angles. FSDNet, a deep network for shadow detection, is evaluated on aerial imagery. Preliminary results indicate that training using automated shadow mask supervision improves performance, and opens the door for developing new deep architectures for shadow detection and enhancement in WAMI.

    * Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as the solution of choice to learn transferable representations from unlabeled data. However, SSL requires to build samples that are known to be semantically akin, i.e. positive views. Requiring such knowledge is the main limitation of SSL and is often tackled by ad-hoc strategies e.g. applying known data-augmentations to the same input. In this work, we generalize and formalize this principle through Positive Active Learning (PAL) where an oracle queries semantic relationships between samples. PAL achieves three main objectives. First, it is a theoretically grounded learning framework that encapsulates standard SSL but also supervised and semi-supervised learning depending on the employed oracle. Second, it provides a consistent algorithm to embed a priori knowledge, e.g. some observed labels, into any SSL losses without any change in the training pipeline. Third, it provides a proper active learning framework yielding low-cost solutions to annotate datasets, arguably bringing the gap between theory and practice of active learning that is based on simple-to-answer-by-non-experts queries of semantic relationships between inputs.

    * Abstract: Because of the diversity in lighting environments, existing illumination estimation techniques have been designed explicitly on indoor or outdoor environments. Methods have focused specifically on capturing accurate energy (e.g., through parametric lighting models), which emphasizes shading and strong cast shadows; or producing plausible texture (e.g., with GANs), which prioritizes plausible reflections. Approaches which provide editable lighting capabilities have been proposed, but these tend to be with simplified lighting models, offering limited realism. In this work, we propose to bridge the gap between these recent trends in the literature, and propose a method which combines a parametric light model with 360deg panoramas, ready to use as HDRI in rendering engines. We leverage recent advances in GAN-based LDR panorama extrapolation from a regular image, which we extend to HDR using parametric spherical gaussians. To achieve this, we introduce a novel lighting co-modulation method that injects lighting-related features throughout the generator, tightly coupling the original or edited scene illumination within the panorama generation process. In our representation, users can easily edit light direction, intensity, number, etc. to impact shading while providing rich, complex reflections while seamlessly blending with the edits. Furthermore, our method encompasses indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating state-of-the-art results even when compared to domain-specific methods.

    * Abstract: While analyzing scanned documents, handwritten text can overlap with printed text. This overlap causes difficulties during the optical character recognition (OCR) and digitization process of documents, and subsequently, hurts downstream NLP tasks. Prior research either focuses solely on the binary classification of handwritten text or performs a three-class segmentation of the document, i.e., recognition of handwritten, printed, and background pixels. This approach results in the assignment of overlapping handwritten and printed pixels to only one of the classes, and thus, they are not accounted for in the other class. Thus, in this research, we develop novel approaches to address the challenges of handwritten and printed text segmentation. Our objective is to recover text from different classes in their entirety, especially enhancing the segmentation performance on overlapping sections. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset, SignaTR6K, collected from real legal documents, as well as a new model architecture for the handwritten and printed text segmentation task. Our best configuration outperforms prior work on two different datasets by 17.9% and 7.3% on IoU scores.

    * Abstract: Instance segmentation requires labor-intensive manual labeling of the contours of complex objects in images for training. The labels can also be provided incrementally in practice to balance the human labor in different time steps. However, research on incremental learning for instance segmentation with only weak labels is still lacking. In this paper, we propose a continual-learning method to segment object instances from image-level labels. Unlike most weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) which relies on traditional object proposals, we transfer the semantic knowledge from weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) to WSIS to generate instance cues. To address the background shift problem in continual learning, we employ the old class segmentation results generated by the previous model to provide more reliable semantic and peak hypotheses. To our knowledge, this is the first work on weakly-supervised continual learning for instance segmentation of images. Experimental results show that our method can achieve better performance on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets under various incremental settings.

    * Abstract: Accurately determining salient regions of an image is challenging when labeled data is scarce. DINO-based self-supervised approaches have recently leveraged meaningful image semantics captured by patch-wise features for locating foreground objects. Recent methods have also incorporated intuitive priors and demonstrated value in unsupervised methods for object partitioning. In this paper, we propose SEMPART, which jointly infers coarse and fine bi-partitions over an image's DINO-based semantic graph. Furthermore, SEMPART preserves fine boundary details using graph-driven regularization and successfully distills the coarse mask semantics into the fine mask. Our salient object detection and single object localization findings suggest that SEMPART produces high-quality masks rapidly without additional post-processing and benefits from co-optimizing the coarse and fine branches.

    * Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph has recently been proposed for comprehensive scene understanding. However, previous works adopt a fully-supervised learning manner, requiring large amounts of pixel-wise densely-annotated data, which is always tedious and expensive to obtain. To address this limitation, we study a new problem of Panoptic Scene Graph Generation from Purely Textual Descriptions (Caption-to-PSG). The key idea is to leverage the large collection of free image-caption data on the Web alone to generate panoptic scene graphs. The problem is very challenging for three constraints: 1) no location priors; 2) no explicit links between visual regions and textual entities; and 3) no pre-defined concept sets. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework TextPSG consisting of four modules, i.e., a region grouper, an entity grounder, a segment merger, and a label generator, with several novel techniques. The region grouper first groups image pixels into different segments and the entity grounder then aligns visual segments with language entities based on the textual description of the segment being referred to. The grounding results can thus serve as pseudo labels enabling the segment merger to learn the segment similarity as well as guiding the label generator to learn object semantics and relation predicates, resulting in a fine-grained structured scene understanding. Our framework is effective, significantly outperforming the baselines and achieving strong out-of-distribution robustness. We perform comprehensive ablation studies to corroborate the effectiveness of our design choices and provide an in-depth analysis to highlight future directions. Our code, data, and results are available on our project page: https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/TextPSG.

    * Abstract: Instance segmentation is a fundamental computer vision problem which remains challenging despite impressive recent advances due to deep learning-based methods. Given sufficient training data, fully supervised methods can yield excellent performance, but annotation of groundtruth remains a major bottleneck, especially for biomedical applications where it has to be performed by domain experts. The amount of labels required can be drastically reduced by using rules derived from prior knowledge to guide the segmentation. However, these rules are in general not differentiable and thus cannot be used with existing methods. Here, we revoke this requirement by using stateless actor critic reinforcement learning, which enables non-differentiable rewards. We formulate the instance segmentation problem as graph partitioning and the actor critic predicts the edge weights driven by the rewards, which are based on the conformity of segmented instances to high-level priors on object shape, position or size. The experiments on toy and real data demonstrate that a good set of priors is sufficient to reach excellent performance without any direct object-level supervision.

    * Abstract: Coronary calcium scoring (CCS) can be quantified on non-gated or gated computed tomography (CT) for screening cardiovascular disease (CVD). And non-gated CT is used for routine coronary artery calcium (CAC) screening due to its affordability. However, artifacts of non-gated CT imaging, pose a significant challenge for automatic scoring. To combat the scoring bias caused by artifacts, we develop a novel semantic-prompt scoring siamese (SPSS) network for automatic CCS of non-gated CT. In SPSS, we establish a sharing network with regression supervised learning and semantic supervised learning. We train the SPSS by mixing non-gated CT without CAC mask and gated CT with CAC mask. In regression supervised learning, the network is trained to predict the CCS of non-gated CT. To combat the influence of motion artifacts, we introduce semantic supervised learning. We utilize gated CT to train the network to learn more accurate CAC semantic features. By integrating regression supervised learning and semantic supervised learning, the semantic information can prompt the regression supervised learning to accurately predict the CCS of non-gated CT. By conducting extensive experiments on publicly available dataset, we prove that the SPSS can alleviate the potential scoring bias introduced by pixel-wise artifact labels. Moreover, our experimental results show that the SPSS establishes state-of-the-art performance.

    * Abstract: Deep learning has met key applications in image computing, but still lacks processing paradigms for meshes, i.e. collections of elementary geometrical parts such as points, segments or triangles. Meshes are both a powerful representation for geometrical objects, and a challenge for network architectures because of their inherent irregular structure. This work contributes to adapt classical deep learning paradigms to this particular type of data in three ways. First, we introduce the current-splatting layer which embeds meshes in a metric space, allowing the downstream network to process them without any assumption on their topology: they may be composed of varied numbers of elements or connected components, contain holes, or bear high levels of geometrical noise. Second, we adapt to meshes the exponentiation layer which, from an upstream image array, generates shapes with a diffeomorphic control over their topology. Third, we take advantage of those layers to devise a variational auto-encoding architecture, which we interpret as a generative statistical model that learns adapted low-dimensional representations for mesh data sets. An explicit norm-control layer ensures the correspondence between the latent-space Euclidean metric and the shape-space log-Euclidean one. We illustrate this method on simulated and real data sets, and show the practical relevance of the learned representation for visualization, classification and mesh synthesis.

    * Abstract: Crowd collectiveness refers to the behavior consistency of crowd scenes, which reflects the degree of collective movements among massive individuals in crowd systems. The existing methods focus on measuring the discrepancy of motion direction among the individuals. However, few studies consider the magnitude discrepancy of velocity in a crowd and the collectiveness among different crowds, which can also affect the overall crowd collectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel descriptor which combines intra-crowd collectiveness with inter-crowd collectiveness to solve the problem. For intra-crowd collectiveness, we introduce the energy spread process to identify the impacting factors of collectiveness, then measure the collectiveness of individuals within a crowd cluster by computing their similarities of magnitude and direction from the optical flow. For inter-crowd collectiveness, we assess the motion consistency among various crowd clusters generated from collective merging. Experimental results demonstrate that how the new collectiveness descriptor improves performance on three different crowd datasets, thus validating the superiority of the proposed descriptor.

    * Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei in volumetric (3D) fluorescence microscopy datasets is an important step in many biomedical research projects. Although many automated methods for these tasks exist, they often struggle for images with low signal-to-noise ratios and/or dense packing of nuclei. It was recently shown for 2D microscopy images that these issues can be alleviated by training a neural network to directly predict a suitable shape representation (star-convex polygon) for cell nuclei. In this paper, we adopt and extend this approach to 3D volumes by using star-convex polyhedra to represent cell nuclei and similar shapes. To that end, we overcome the challenges of 1) finding parameter-efficient star-convex polyhedra representations that can faithfully describe cell nuclei shapes, 2) adapting to anisotropic voxel sizes often found in fluorescence microscopy datasets, and 3) efficiently computing intersections between pairs of star-convex polyhedra (required for non-maximum suppression). Although our approach is quite general, since star-convex polyhedra include common shapes like bounding boxes and spheres as special cases, our focus is on accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei. Finally, we demonstrate on two challenging datasets that our approach (StarDist-3D) leads to superior results when compared to classical and deep learning based methods.

    * Abstract: This paper proposes a method for automatically recovering data from chart images. In particular we focus on the task of estimating line charts, as the most common chart type, in a fully automatic way that handles line occlusions, as well as lines of different styles, e.g., dashed or dotted. For this, we first train a single semantic segmentation network to predict probability maps for each different line styles. We then construct a graph based on this output and formulate the line tracing task as a minimum-cost-flow problem, optimizing a cost function using linear programming. From the traced lines, the axes, and text labels, we recover the numerical values used to generate the chart. In experiments on six datasets, containing both synthesized and crawled images, we show significant improvements over prior work.

    * Abstract: We propose a new approach for paragraph recognition in document images by spatial graph convolutional networks (GCN) applied on OCR text boxes. Two steps, namely line splitting and line clustering, are performed to extract paragraphs from the lines in OCR results. Each step uses a beta-skeleton graph constructed from bounding boxes, where the graph edges provide efficient support for graph convolution operations. With pure layout input features, the GCN model size is 3 4 orders of magnitude smaller compared to R-CNN based models, while achieving comparable or better accuracies on PubLayNet and other datasets. Furthermore, the GCN models show good generalization from synthetic training data to real-world images, and good adaptivity for variable document styles.

    * Abstract: Applications based on image retrieval require editing and associating in intermediate spaces that are representative of the high-level concepts like objects and their relationships rather than dense, pixel-level representations like RGB images or semantic-label maps. We focus on one such representation, scene graphs, and propose a novel scene expansion task where we enrich an input seed graph by adding new nodes (objects) and the corresponding relationships. To this end, we formulate scene graph expansion as a sequential prediction task involving multiple iterations of first predicting a new node and then predicting the set of relationships between the newly predicted node and previously chosen nodes in the graph. We propose and evaluate a sequencing strategy that retains the clustering patterns amongst nodes. In addition, we leverage external knowledge to train our graph generation model, enabling greater generalization of node predictions. Due to the inefficiency of existing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based metrics standard for graph generation problems, we design novel metrics that comprehensively evaluate different aspects of node and relation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on Visual Genome and VRD datasets to evaluate the expanded scene graphs using the standard MMD based metrics and our proposed metrics. We observe that the graphs generated by our method, GEMS, better represent the real distribution of the scene graphs compared with baseline methods like GraphRNN.

    * Abstract: The costly process of obtaining semantic segmentation labels has driven research towards weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, using only image-level, point, or box labels. Such annotations introduce limitations and challenges that results in overly-tuned methods specialized in specific domains or scene types. The over reliance of image-level based methods on generation of high quality class activation maps (CAMs) results in limited applicable dataset complexity range, mostly focusing on object centric scenes. Additionally, the lack of dense annotations requires methods to increase network complexity to obtain additional semantic information, often done through multiple stages of training and refinement. Here, we present a single-stage approach generalizable to a wide range of dataset complexities, that is trainable from scratch, without any dependency on pre-trained backbones, classification, or separate refinement tasks. We utilize point annotations to generate reliable, on-the-fly pseudo-masks through refined and spatially filtered features. We are to demonstrate SOTA performance on benchmark datasets (PascalVOC 2012), as well as significantly outperform other SOTA WSSS methods on recent real-world datasets (CRAID, CityPersons, IAD, ADE20K, CityScapes) with up to 28.1% and 22.6% performance boosts compared to our single-stage and multi-stage baselines respectively.

    * Abstract: Layout analysis is a task of uttermost importance in ancient handwritten document analysis and represents a fundamental step toward the simplification of subsequent tasks such as optical character recognition and automatic transcription. However, many of the approaches adopted to solve this problem rely on a fully supervised learning paradigm. While these systems achieve very good performance on this task, the drawback is that pixel-precise text labeling of the entire training set is a very time-consuming process, which makes this type of information rarely available in a real-world scenario. In the present paper, we address this problem by proposing an efficient few-shot learning framework that achieves performances comparable to current state-of-the-art fully supervised methods on the publicly available DIVA-HisDB dataset

    * Abstract: Monitoring a fleet of robots requires stable long-term tracking with re-identification, which is yet an unsolved challenge in many scenarios. One application of this is the analysis of autonomous robotic soccer games at RoboCup. Tracking in these games requires handling of identically looking players, strong occlusions, and non-professional video recordings, but also offers state information estimated by the robots. In order to make effective use of the information coming from the robot sensors, we propose a robust tracking and identification pipeline. It fuses external non-calibrated camera data with the robots' internal states using quadratic optimization for tracklet matching. The approach is validated using game recordings from previous RoboCup World Cup tournaments.

    * Abstract: Many machine learning-based axon tracing methods rely on image datasets with segmentation labels. This requires manual annotation from domain experts, which is labor-intensive and not practical for large-scale brain mapping on hemisphere or whole brain tissue at cellular or sub-cellular resolution. Additionally, preserving axon structure topology is crucial to understanding neural connections and brain function. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning framework that allows models to learn an auxiliary task on unannotated data to aid performance on a supervised target task. In this work, we propose a novel SSL auxiliary task of reconstructing an edge detector for the target task of topology-oriented axon segmentation and centerline detection. We pretrained 3D U-Nets on three different SSL tasks using a mouse brain dataset: our proposed task, predicting the order of permuted slices, and playing a Rubik's cube. We then evaluated these U-Nets and a baseline model on a different mouse brain dataset. Across all experiments, the U-Net pretrained on our proposed task improved the baseline's segmentation, topology-preservation, and centerline detection by up to 5.03%, 4.65%, and 5.41%, respectively. In contrast, there was no consistent improvement over the baseline observed with the slice-permutation and Rubik's cube pretrained U-Nets.

We validate the appropriateness of our model by achieving state-of-the-art performance on a link prediction task and by achieving semantic coherence equivalent to that of latent Dirichlet allocation. We demonstrate the capability of our model for descriptive, explanatory, and exploratory analysis by investigating the inferred topic-specific communication patterns of a new government email dataset, the New Hanover County email corpus.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we consider the $\ell_1$ regularized sparse inverse covariance matrix estimation problem with a very large number of variables. Even in the face of this high dimensionality, and with limited number of samples, recent work has shown this estimator to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering the true structure of the sparse inverse covariance matrix, or alternatively the underlying graph structure of the corresponding Gaussian Markov Random Field. Our proposed algorithm divides the problem into smaller sub-problems, and uses the solutions of the sub-problems to build a good approximation for the original problem. We derive a bound on the distance of the approximate solution to the true solution. Based on this bound, we propose a clustering algorithm that attempts to minimize this bound, and in practice, is able to find effective partitions of the variables. We further use the approximate solution, i.e., solution resulting from solving the sub-problems, as an initial point to solve the original problem, and achieve a much faster computational procedure. As an example, a recent state-of-the-art method, QUIC requires 10 hours to solve a problem (with 10,000 nodes) that arises from a climate application, while our proposed algorithm, Divide and Conquer QUIC (DC-QUIC) only requires one hour to solve the problem.

    * Abstract: We develop a method for discovering the parts of an articulated object from aligned meshes capturing various three-dimensional (3D) poses. We adapt the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) to allow nonparametric discovery of a potentially unbounded number of parts, while simultaneously guaranteeing a spatially connected segmentation. To allow analysis of datasets in which object instances have varying shapes, we model part variability across poses via affine transformations. By placing a matrix normal-inverse-Wishart prior on these affine transformations, we develop a ddCRP Gibbs sampler which tractably marginalizes over transformation uncertainty. Analyzing a dataset of humans captured in dozens of poses, we infer parts which provide quantitatively better motion predictions than conventional clustering methods.

    * Abstract: We present very efficient active learning algorithms for link classification in signed networks. Our algorithms are motivated by a stochastic model in which edge labels are obtained through perturbations of a initial sign assignment consistent with a two-clustering of the nodes. We provide a theoretical analysis within this model, showing that we can achieve an optimal (to whithin a constant factor) number of mistakes on any graph $G = (V,E)$ such that $|E|$ is at least order of $|V|^{3/2}$ by querying at most order of $|V|^{3/2}$ edge labels. More generally, we show an algorithm that achieves optimality to within a factor of order $k$ by querying at most order of $|V| + (|V|/k)^{3/2}$ edge labels. The running time of this algorithm is at most of order $|E| + |V|\log|V|$.

    * Abstract: We consider energy minimization for undirected graphical models, also known as MAP-inference problem for Markov random fields. Although combinatorial methods, which return a provably optimal integral solution of the problem, made a big progress in the past decade, they are still typically unable to cope with large-scale datasets. On the other hand, large scale datasets are typically defined on sparse graphs, and convex relaxation methods, such as linear programming relaxations often provide good approximations to integral solutions. We propose a novel method of combining combinatorial and convex programming techniques to obtain a global solution of the initial combinatorial problem. Based on the information obtained from the solution of the convex relaxation, our method confines application of the combinatorial solver to a small fraction of the initial graphical model, which allows to optimally solve big problems. We demonstrate the power of our approach on a computer vision energy minimization benchmark.

    * Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of transductive pairwise classification from pairwise similarities~\footnote{The pairwise similarities are usually derived from some side information instead of the underlying class labels.}. The goal of transductive pairwise classification from pairwise similarities is to infer the pairwise class relationships, to which we refer as pairwise labels, between all examples given a subset of class relationships for a small set of examples, to which we refer as labeled examples. We propose a very simple yet effective algorithm that consists of two simple steps: the first step is to complete the sub-matrix corresponding to the labeled examples and the second step is to reconstruct the label matrix from the completed sub-matrix and the provided similarity matrix. Our analysis exhibits that under several mild preconditions we can recover the label matrix with a small error, if the top eigen-space that corresponds to the largest eigenvalues of the similarity matrix covers well the column space of label matrix and is subject to a low coherence, and the number of observed pairwise labels is sufficiently enough. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by several experiments.

    * Abstract: The cutting plane method is an augmentative constrained optimization procedure that is often used with continuous-domain optimization techniques such as linear and convex programs. We investigate the viability of a similar idea within message passing -- for integral solutions -- in the context of two combinatorial problems: 1) For Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we propose a factor-graph based on Held-Karp formulation, with an exponential number of constraint factors, each of which has an exponential but sparse tabular form. 2) For graph-partitioning (a.k.a. community mining) using modularity optimization, we introduce a binary variable model with a large number of constraints that enforce formation of cliques. In both cases we are able to derive surprisingly simple message updates that lead to competitive solutions on benchmark instances. In particular for TSP we are able to find near-optimal solutions in the time that empirically grows with $N^3$, demonstrating that augmentation is practical and efficient.

    * Abstract: Consistently matching keypoints across images, and the related problem of finding clusters of nearby images, are critical components of various tasks in Computer Vision, including Structure from Motion (SfM). Unfortunately, occlusion and large repetitive structures tend to mislead most currently used matching algorithms, leading to characteristic pathologies in the final output. In this paper we introduce a new method, Permutations Diffusion Maps (PDM), to solve the matching problem, as well as a related new affinity measure, derived using ideas from harmonic analysis on the symmetric group. We show that just by using it as a preprocessing step to existing SfM pipelines, PDM can greatly improve reconstruction quality on difficult datasets.

    * Abstract: Subspace clustering is an unsupervised learning problem that aims at grouping data points into multiple clusters'' so that data points in a single cluster lie approximately on a low-dimensional linear subspace. It is originally motivated by 3D motion segmentation in computer vision, but has recently been generically applied to a wide range of statistical machine learning problems, which often involves sensitive datasets about human subjects. This raises a dire concern for data privacy. In this work, we build on the framework ofdifferential privacy'' and present two provably private subspace clustering algorithms. We demonstrate via both theory and experiments that one of the presented methods enjoys formal privacy and utility guarantees; the other one asymptotically preserves differential privacy while having good performance in practice. Along the course of the proof, we also obtain two new provable guarantees for the agnostic subspace clustering and the graph connectivity problem which might be of independent interests.

    * Abstract: We show that the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of models derived from Luce's choice axiom (e.g., the Plackett-Luce model) can be expressed as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. This conveys insight into several recently proposed spectral inference algorithms. We take advantage of this perspective and formulate a new spectral algorithm that is significantly more accurate than previous ones for the Plackett--Luce model. With a simple adaptation, this algorithm can be used iteratively, producing a sequence of estimates that converges to the ML estimate. The ML version runs faster than competing approaches on a benchmark of five datasets. Our algorithms are easy to implement, making them relevant for practitioners at large.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. These diagrams encode persistent homology, a widely used invariant in topological data analysis. While several avenues towards a statistical treatment of the diagrams have been explored recently, we follow an alternative route that is motivated by the success of methods based on the embedding of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In fact, a positive definite kernel on persistence diagrams has recently been proposed, connecting persistent homology to popular kernel-based learning techniques such as support vector machines. However, important properties of that kernel which would enable a principled use in the context of probability measure embeddings remain to be explored. Our contribution is to close this gap by proving universality of a variant of the original kernel, and to demonstrate its effective use in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic as well as real-world data.

    * Abstract: We study the problem of online rank elicitation, assuming that rankings of a set of alternatives obey the Plackett-Luce distribution. Following the setting of the dueling bandits problem, the learner is allowed to query pairwise comparisons between alternatives, i.e., to sample pairwise marginals of the distribution in an online fashion. Using this information, the learner seeks to reliably predict the most probable ranking (or top-alternative). Our approach is based on constructing a surrogate probability distribution over rankings based on a sorting procedure, for which the pairwise marginals provably coincide with the marginals of the Plackett-Luce distribution. In addition to a formal performance and complexity analysis, we present first experimental studies.

    * Abstract: Gibbs sampling on factor graphs is a widely used inference technique, which often produces good empirical results. Theoretical guarantees for its performance are weak: even for tree structured graphs, the mixing time of Gibbs may be exponential in the number of variables. To help understand the behavior of Gibbs sampling, we introduce a new (hyper)graph property, called hierarchy width. We show that under suitable conditions on the weights, bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time. Our study of hierarchy width is in part motivated by a class of factor graph templates, hierarchical templates, which have bounded hierarchy width—regardless of the data used to instantiate them. We demonstrate a rich application from natural language processing in which Gibbs sampling provably mixes rapidly and achieves accuracy that exceeds human volunteers.

    * Abstract: We introduce a new machine learning approach for image segmentation that uses a neural network to model the conditional energy of a segmentation given an image. Our approach, combinatorial energy learning for image segmentation (CELIS) places a particular emphasis on modeling the inherent combinatorial nature of dense image segmentation problems. We propose efficient algorithms for learning deep neural networks to model the energy function, and for local optimization of this energy in the space of supervoxel agglomerations. We extensively evaluate our method on a publicly available 3-D microscopy dataset with 25 billion voxels of ground truth data. On an 11 billion voxel test set, we find that our method improves volumetric reconstruction accuracy by more than 20% as compared to two state-of-the-art baseline methods: graph-based segmentation of the output of a 3-D convolutional neural network trained to predict boundaries, as well as a random forest classifier trained to agglomerate supervoxels that were generated by a 3-D convolutional neural network.

    * Abstract: Statistical relational models provide compact encodings of probabilistic dependencies in relational domains, but result in highly intractable graphical models. The goal of lifted inference is to carry out probabilistic inference without needing to reason about each individual separately, by instead treating exchangeable, undistinguished objects as a whole. In this paper, we study the domain recursion inference rule, which, despite its central role in early theoretical results on domain-lifted inference, has later been believed redundant. We show that this rule is more powerful than expected, and in fact significantly extends the range of models for which lifted inference runs in time polynomial in the number of individuals in the domain. This includes an open problem called S4, the symmetric transitivity model, and a first-order logic encoding of the birthday paradox. We further identify new classes S2FO2 and S2RU of domain-liftable theories, which respectively subsume FO2 and recursively unary theories, the largest classes of domain-liftable theories known so far, and show that using domain recursion can achieve exponential speedup even in theories that cannot fully be lifted with the existing set of inference rules.

    * Abstract: Inferring topological and geometrical information from data can offer an alternative perspective in machine learning problems. Methods from topological data analysis, e.g., persistent homology, enable us to obtain such information, typically in the form of summary representations of topological features. However, such topological signatures often come with an unusual structure (e.g., multisets of intervals) that is highly impractical for most machine learning techniques. While many strategies have been proposed to map these topological signatures into machine learning compatible representations, they suffer from being agnostic to the target learning task. In contrast, we propose a technique that enables us to input topological signatures to deep neural networks and learn a task-optimal representation during training. Our approach is realized as a novel input layer with favorable theoretical properties. Classification experiments on 2D object shapes and social network graphs demonstrate the versatility of the approach and, in case of the latter, we even outperform the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

    * Abstract: Hiererachical clustering, that is computing a recursive partitioning of a dataset to obtain clusters at increasingly finer granularity is a fundamental problem in data analysis. Although hierarchical clustering has mostly been studied through procedures such as linkage algorithms, or top-down heuristics, rather than as optimization problems, recently Dasgupta [1] proposed an objective function for hierarchical clustering and initiated a line of work developing algorithms that explicitly optimize an objective (see also [2, 3, 4]). In this paper, we consider a fairly general random graph model for hierarchical clustering, called the hierarchical stochastic blockmodel (HSBM), and show that in certain regimes the SVD approach of McSherry [5] combined with specific linkage methods results in a clustering that give an O(1)-approximation to Dasgupta’s cost function. We also show that an approach based on SDP relaxations for balanced cuts based on the work of Makarychev et al. [6], combined with the recursive sparsest cut algorithm of Dasgupta, yields an O(1) approximation in slightly larger regimes and also in the semi-random setting, where an adversary may remove edges from the random graph generated according to an HSBM. Finally, we report empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world data showing that our proposed SVD-based method does indeed achieve a better cost than other widely-used heurstics and also results in a better classification accuracy when the underlying problem was that of multi-class classification.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning a mixture of Gaussians with streaming data: given a stream of $N$ points in $d$ dimensions generated by an unknown mixture of $k$ spherical Gaussians, the goal is to estimate the model parameters using a single pass over the data stream. We analyze a streaming version of the popular Lloyd's heuristic and show that the algorithm estimates all the unknown centers of the component Gaussians accurately if they are sufficiently separated. Assuming each pair of centers are $C\sigma$ distant with $C=\Omega((k\log k)^{1/4}\sigma)$ and where $\sigma^2$ is the maximum variance of any Gaussian component, we show that asymptotically the algorithm estimates the centers optimally (up to certain constants); our center separation requirement matches the best known result for spherical Gaussians \citep{vempalawang}. For finite samples, we show that a bias term based on the initial estimate decreases at $O(1/{\rm poly}(N))$ rate while variance decreases at nearly optimal rate of $\sigma^2 d/N$. Our analysis requires seeding the algorithm with a good initial estimate of the true cluster centers for which we provide an online PCA based clustering algorithm. Indeed, the asymptotic per-step time complexity of our algorithm is the optimal $d\cdot k$ while space complexity of our algorithm is $O(dk\log k)$. In addition to the bias and variance terms which tend to $0$, the hard-thresholding based updates of streaming Lloyd's algorithm is agnostic to the data distribution and hence incurs an \emph{approximation error} that cannot be avoided. However, by using a streaming version of the classical \emph{(soft-thresholding-based)} EM method that exploits the Gaussian distribution explicitly, we show that for a mixture of two Gaussians the true means can be estimated consistently, with estimation error decreasing at nearly optimal rate, and tending to $0$ for $N\rightarrow \infty$.

    * Authors: Yilin Zhang, Karl Rohe
    * Abstract: This paper uses the relationship between graph conductance and spectral clustering to study (i) the failures of spectral clustering and (ii) the benefits of regularization. The explanation is simple. Sparse and stochastic graphs create several dangling sets'', or small trees that are connected to the core of the graph by only one edge. Graph conductance is sensitive to these noisy dangling sets and spectral clustering inherits this sensitivity. The second part of the paper starts from a previously proposed form of regularized spectral clustering and shows that it is related to the graph conductance on aregularized graph''. When graph conductance is computed on the regularized graph, we call it CoreCut. Based upon previous arguments that relate graph conductance to spectral clustering (e.g. Cheeger inequality), minimizing CoreCut relaxes to regularized spectral clustering. Simple inspection of CoreCut reveals why it is less sensitive to dangling sets. Together, these results show that unbalanced partitions from spectral clustering can be understood as overfitting to noise in the periphery of a sparse and stochastic graph. Regularization fixes this overfitting. In addition to this statistical benefit, these results also demonstrate how regularization can improve the computational speed of spectral clustering. We provide simulations and data examples to illustrate these results.

    * Abstract: Algebraic topology methods have recently played an important role for statistical analysis with complicated geometric structured data such as shapes, linked twist maps, and material data. Among them, \textit{persistent homology} is a well-known tool to extract robust topological features, and outputs as \textit{persistence diagrams} (PDs). However, PDs are point multi-sets which can not be used in machine learning algorithms for vector data. To deal with it, an emerged approach is to use kernel methods, and an appropriate geometry for PDs is an important factor to measure the similarity of PDs. A popular geometry for PDs is the \textit{Wasserstein metric}. However, Wasserstein distance is not \textit{negative definite}. Thus, it is limited to build positive definite kernels upon the Wasserstein distance \textit{without approximation}. In this work, we rely upon the alternative \textit{Fisher information geometry} to propose a positive definite kernel for PDs \textit{without approximation}, namely the Persistence Fisher (PF) kernel. Then, we analyze eigensystem of the integral operator induced by the proposed kernel for kernel machines. Based on that, we derive generalization error bounds via covering numbers and Rademacher averages for kernel machines with the PF kernel. Additionally, we show some nice properties such as stability and infinite divisibility for the proposed kernel. Furthermore, we also propose a linear time complexity over the number of points in PDs for an approximation of our proposed kernel with a bounded error. Throughout experiments with many different tasks on various benchmark datasets, we illustrate that the PF kernel compares favorably with other baseline kernels for PDs.

    * Abstract: We study the set of continuous functions that admit no spurious local optima (i.e. local minima that are not global minima) which we term global functions. They satisfy various powerful properties for analyzing nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems. For instance, they satisfy a theorem akin to the fundamental uniform limit theorem in the analysis regarding continuous functions. Global functions are also endowed with useful properties regarding the composition of functions and change of variables. Using these new results, we show that a class of non-differentiable nonconvex optimization problems arising in tensor decomposition applications are global functions. This is the first result concerning nonconvex methods for nonsmooth objective functions. Our result provides a theoretical guarantee for the widely-used $\ell_1$ norm to avoid outliers in nonconvex optimization.

This is in contrast to existing generative models that represent data density, and are strongly affected by noise and other artifacts of data collection. We demonstrate how this approach corrects sampling biases and artifacts, thus improves several downstream data analysis tasks, such as clustering and classification. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach is especially useful in biology where, despite the advent of single-cell technologies, rare subpopulations and gene-interaction relationships are affected by biased sampling. We show that SUGAR can generate hypothetical populations, and it is able to reveal intrinsic patterns and mutual-information relationships between genes on a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of hematopoiesis.

    * Abstract: We present computationally efficient algorithms to test various combinatorial structures of large-scale graphical models. In order to test the hypotheses on their topological structures, we propose two adjacency matrix sketching frameworks: neighborhood sketching and subgraph sketching. The neighborhood sketching algorithm is proposed to test the connectivity of graphical models. This algorithm randomly subsamples vertices and conducts neighborhood regression and screening. The global sketching algorithm is proposed to test the topological properties requiring exponential computation complexity, especially testing the chromatic number and the maximum clique. This algorithm infers the corresponding property based on the sampled subgraph. Our algorithms are shown to substantially accelerate the computation of existing methods. We validate our theory and method through both synthetic simulations and a real application in neuroscience.

    * Abstract: Semantic segmentation models are limited in their ability to scale to large numbers of object classes. In this paper, we introduce the new task of zero-shot semantic segmentation: learning pixel-wise classifiers for never-seen object categories with zero training examples. To this end, we present a novel architecture, ZS3Net, combining a deep visual segmentation model with an approach to generate visual representations from semantic word embeddings. By this way, ZS3Net addresses pixel classification tasks where both seen and unseen categories are faced at test time (so called generalized zero-shot classification). Performance is further improved by a self-training step that relies on automatic pseudo-labeling of pixels from unseen classes. On the two standard segmentation datasets, Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context, we propose zero-shot benchmarks and set competitive baselines. For complex scenes as ones in the Pascal-Context dataset, we extend our approach by using a graph-context encoding to fully leverage spatial context priors coming from class-wise segmentation maps.

A series of methods have been developed to map a persistence diagram to a vector representation so as to facilitate the downstream use of machine learning tools. In these approaches, the importance (weight) of different persistence features are usually pre-set. However often in practice, the choice of the weight-function should depend on the nature of the specific data at hand. It is thus highly desirable to learn a best weight-function (and thus metric for persistence diagrams) from labelled data. We study this problem and develop a new weighted kernel, called WKPI, for persistence summaries, as well as an optimization framework to learn the weight (and thus kernel). We apply the learned kernel to the challenging task of graph classification, and show that our WKPI-based classification framework obtains similar or (sometimes significantly) better results than the best results from a range of previous graph classification frameworks on a collection of benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Causal inference in randomized experiments typically assumes that the units of randomization and the units of analysis are one and the same. In some applications, however, these two roles are played by distinct entities linked by a bipartite graph. The key challenge in such bipartite settings is how to avoid interference bias, which would typically arise if we simply randomized the treatment at the level of analysis units. One effective way of minimizing interference bias in standard experiments is through cluster randomization, but this design has not been studied in the bipartite setting where conventional clustering schemes can lead to poorly powered experiments. This paper introduces a novel clustering objective and a corresponding algorithm that partitions a bipartite graph so as to maximize the statistical power of a bipartite experiment on that graph. Whereas previous work relied on balanced partitioning, our formulation suggests the use of a correlation clustering objective. We use a publicly-available graph of Amazon user-item reviews to validate our solution and illustrate how it substantially increases the statistical power in bipartite experiments.

    * Abstract: Recently, neural network based approaches have achieved significant progress for solving large, complex, graph-structured problems. Nevertheless, the advantages of multi-scale information and deep architectures have not been sufficiently exploited. In this paper, we first analyze key factors constraining the expressive power of existing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), including the activation function and shallow learning mechanisms. Then, we generalize spectral graph convolution and deep GCN in block Krylov subspace forms, upon which we devise two architectures, both scalable in depth however making use of multi-scale information differently. On several node classification tasks, the proposed architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we study private sparsification of graphs. In particular, we give an algorithm that given an input graph, returns a sparse graph which approximates the spectrum of the input graph while ensuring differential privacy. This allows one to solve many graph problems privately yet efficiently and accurately. This is exemplified with application of the proposed meta-algorithm to graph algorithms for privately answering cut-queries, as well as practical algorithms for computing {\scshape MAX-CUT} and {\scshape SPARSEST-CUT} with better accuracy than previously known. We also give the first efficient private algorithm to learn Laplacian eigenmap on a graph.

    * Abstract: Clustering is an important topic in algorithms, and has a number of applications in machine learning, computer vision, statistics, and several other research disciplines. Traditional objectives of graph clustering are to find clusters with low conductance. Not only are these objectives just applicable for undirected graphs, they are also incapable to take the relationships between clusters into account, which could be crucial for many applications. To overcome these downsides, we study directed graphs (digraphs) whose clusters exhibit further “structural” information amongst each other. Based on the Hermitian matrix representation of digraphs, we present a nearly-linear time algorithm for digraph clustering, and further show that our proposed algorithm can be implemented in sublinear time under reasonable assumptions. The significance of our theoretical work is demonstrated by extensive experimental results on the UN Comtrade Dataset: the output clustering of our algorithm exhibits not only how the clusters (sets of countries) relate to each other with respect to their import and export records, but also how these clusters evolve over time, in accordance with known facts in international trade.

    * Abstract: Meshes are important representations of physical 3D entities in the virtual world. Applications like rendering, simulations and 3D printing require meshes to be manifold so that they can interact with the world like the real objects they represent. Prior methods generate meshes with great geometric accuracy but poor manifoldness. In this work, we propose NeuralMeshFlow (NMF) to generate two-manifold meshes for genus-0 shapes. Specifically, NMF is a shape auto-encoder consisting of several Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE)(1) blocks that learn accurate mesh geometry by progressively deforming a spherical mesh. Training NMF is simpler compared to state-of-the-art methods since it does not require any explicit mesh-based regularization. Our experiments demonstrate that NMF facilitates several applications such as single-view mesh reconstruction, global shape parameterization, texture mapping, shape deformation and correspondence. Importantly, we demonstrate that manifold meshes generated using NMF are better-suited for physically-based rendering and simulation compared to prior works.

    * Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically applied to static graphs that are assumed to be known upfront. This static input structure is often informed purely by insight of the machine learning practitioner, and might not be optimal for the actual task the GNN is solving. In absence of reliable domain expertise, one might resort to inferring the latent graph structure, which is often difficult due to the vast search space of possible graphs. Here we introduce Pointer Graph Networks (PGNs) which augment sets or graphs with additional inferred edges for improved model generalisation ability. PGNs allow each node to dynamically point to another node, followed by message passing over these pointers. The sparsity of this adaptable graph structure makes learning tractable while still being sufficiently expressive to simulate complex algorithms. Critically, the pointing mechanism is directly supervised to model long-term sequences of operations on classical data structures, incorporating useful structural inductive biases from theoretical computer science. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that PGNs can learn parallelisable variants of pointer-based data structures, namely disjoint set unions and link/cut trees. PGNs generalise out-of-distribution to 5x larger test inputs on dynamic graph connectivity tasks, outperforming unrestricted GNNs and Deep Sets.

    * Abstract: We study symmetric spiked matrix models with respect to a general class of noise distributions. Given a rank-1 deformation of a random noise matrix, whose entries are independently distributed with zero mean and unit variance, the goal is to estimate the rank-1 part. For the case of Gaussian noise, the top eigenvector of the given matrix is a widely-studied estimator known to achieve optimal statistical guarantees, e.g., in the sense of the celebrated BBP phase transition. However, this estimator can fail completely for heavy-tailed noise. In this work, we exhibit an estimator that works for heavy-tailed noise up to the BBP threshold that is optimal even for Gaussian noise. We give a non-asymptotic analysis of our estimator which relies only on the variance of each entry remaining constant as the size of the matrix grows: higher moments may grow arbitrarily fast or even fail to exist. Previously, it was only known how to achieve these guarantees if higher-order moments of the noises are bounded by a constant independent of the size of the matrix. Our estimator can be evaluated in polynomial time by counting self-avoiding walks via a color coding technique. Moreover, we extend our estimator to spiked tensor models and establish analogous results.

    * Abstract: In recent years, post-hoc local instance-level and global dataset-level explainability of black-box models has received a lot of attention. Lesser attention has been given to obtaining insights at intermediate or group levels, which is a need outlined in recent works that study the challenges in realizing the guidelines in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper, we propose a meta-method that, given a typical local explainability method, can build a multilevel explanation tree. The leaves of this tree correspond to local explanations, the root corresponds to global explanation, and intermediate levels correspond to explanations for groups of data points that it automatically clusters. The method can also leverage side information, where users can specify points for which they may want the explanations to be similar. We argue that such a multilevel structure can also be an effective form of communication, where one could obtain few explanations that characterize the entire dataset by considering an appropriate level in our explanation tree. Explanations for novel test points can be cost-efficiently obtained by associating them with the closest training points. When the local explainability technique is generalized additive (viz. LIME, GAMs), we develop fast approximate algorithm for building the multilevel tree and study its convergence behavior. We show that we produce high fidelity sparse explanations on several public datasets and also validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique based on two human studies -- one with experts and the other with non-expert users -- on real world datasets.

    * Abstract: We propose the use of hyperedge replacement graph grammars for factor graphs, or factor graph grammars (FGGs) for short. FGGs generate sets of factor graphs and can describe a more general class of models than plate notation, dynamic graphical models, case-factor diagrams, and sum-product networks can. Moreover, inference can be done on FGGs without enumerating all the generated factor graphs. For finite variable domains (but possibly infinite sets of graphs), a generalization of variable elimination to FGGs allows exact and tractable inference in many situations. For finite sets of graphs (but possibly infinite variable domains), a FGG can be converted to a single factor graph amenable to standard inference techniques.

    * Abstract: Learning heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems through graph neural networks have recently shown promising results on some classic NP-hard problems. These are single-level optimization problems with only one player. Multilevel combinatorial optimization problems are their generalization, encompassing situations with multiple players taking decisions sequentially. By framing them in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting, we devise a value-based method to learn to solve multilevel budgeted combinatorial problems involving two players in a zero-sum game over a graph. Our framework is based on a simple curriculum: if an agent knows how to estimate the value of instances with budgets up to $B$, then solving instances with budget $B+1$ can be done in polynomial time regardless of the direction of the optimization by checking the value of every possible afterstate. Thus, in a bottom-up approach, we generate datasets of heuristically solved instances with increasingly larger budgets to train our agent. We report results close to optimality on graphs up to $100$ nodes and a $185 \times$ speedup on average compared to the quickest exact solver known for the Multilevel Critical Node problem, a max-min-max trilevel problem that has been shown to be at least $\Sigma_2^p$-hard.

    * Abstract: We propose a distributionally robust model for the influence maximization problem. Unlike the classical independent cascade model of Kempe et al (2003), this model's diffusion process is adversarially adapted to the choice of seed set. So instead of optimizing under the assumption that all influence relationships in the network are independent, we seek a seed set whose expected influence under the worst correlation, i.e., the ``worst-case, expected influence", is maximized. We show that this worst-case influence can be efficiently computed, and though the optimization is NP-hard, a (1 - 1/e) approximation guarantee holds. We also analyze the structure to the adversary's choice of diffusion process, and contrast with established models. Beyond the key computational advantages, we also study the degree to which the independence assumption may be considered costly, and provide insights from numerical experiments comparing the adversarial and independent cascade model.

    * Abstract: Accurately and efficiently characterizing the decision boundary of classifiers is important for problems related to model selection and meta-learning. Inspired by topological data analysis, the characterization of decision boundaries using their homology has recently emerged as a general and powerful tool. In this paper, we propose an active learning algorithm to recover the homology of decision boundaries. Our algorithm sequentially and adaptively selects which samples it requires the labels of. We theoretically analyze the proposed framework and show that the query complexity of our active learning algorithm depends naturally on the intrinsic complexity of the underlying manifold. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in selecting best-performing machine learning models for datasets just using their respective homological summaries. Experiments on several standard datasets show the sample complexity improvement in recovering the homology and demonstrate the practical utility of the framework for model selection.

    * Abstract: Although the foundations of ranking are well established, the ranking literature has primarily been focused on simple, unimodal models, e.g. the Mallows and Plackett-Luce models, that define distributions centered around a single total ordering. Explicit mixture models have provided some tools for modelling multimodal ranking data, though learning such models from data is often difficult. In this work, we contribute a contextual repeated selection (CRS) model that leverages recent advances in choice modeling to bring a natural multimodality and richness to the rankings space. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for maximum likelihood estimation under the model through structure-dependent tail risk and expected risk bounds. As a by-product, we also furnish the first tight bounds on the expected risk of maximum likelihood estimators for the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model and the Plackett-Luce (PL) ranking model, as well as the first tail risk bound on the PL ranking model. The CRS model significantly outperforms existing methods for modeling real world ranking data in a variety of settings, from racing to rank choice voting.

    * Abstract: The Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) presents a remarkable approach to alleviate the scale variance in object representation by performing instance-level assignments. Nevertheless, this strategy ignores the distinct characteristics of different sub-regions in an instance. To this end, we propose a fine-grained dynamic head to conditionally select a pixel-level combination of FPN features from different scales for each instance, which further releases the ability of multi-scale feature representation. Moreover, we design a spatial gate with the new activation function to reduce computational complexity dramatically through spatially sparse convolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method on several state-of-the-art detection benchmarks.

We propose the Community Hawkes Independent Pairs (CHIP) generative model for such networks. We show that applying spectral clustering to an aggregated adjacency matrix constructed from the CHIP model provides consistent community detection for a growing number of nodes and time duration. We also develop consistent and computationally efficient estimators for the model parameters. We demonstrate that our proposed CHIP model and estimation procedure scales to large networks with tens of thousands of nodes and provides superior fits than existing continuous-time network models on several real networks.

    * Abstract: In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in topological data analysis, a new methodology for using geometric structures in data for inference and learning. A central theme in the area is the idea of persistence, which in its most basic form studies how measures of shape change as a scale parameter varies. There are now a number of frameworks that support statistics and machine learning in this context. However, in many applications there are several different parameters one might wish to vary: for example, scale and density. In contrast to the one-parameter setting, techniques for applying statistics and machine learning in the setting of multiparameter persistence are not well understood due to the lack of a concise representation of the results. We introduce a new descriptor for multiparameter persistence, which we call the Multiparameter Persistence Image, that is suitable for machine learning and statistical frameworks, is robust to perturbations in the data, has finer resolution than existing descriptors based on slicing, and can be efficiently computed on data sets of realistic size. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy by comparing its performance to other multiparameter descriptors on several classification tasks.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection remains a grand challenge due to the variation in text curvatures, orientations, and aspect ratios. One of the hardest problems in this task is how to represent text instances of arbitrary shapes. Although many methods have been proposed to model irregular texts in a flexible manner, most of them lose simplicity and robustness. Their complicated post-processings and the regression under Dirac delta distribution undermine the detection performance and the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose an efficient text instance representation named CentripetalText (CT), which decomposes text instances into the combination of text kernels and centripetal shifts. Specifically, we utilize the centripetal shifts to implement pixel aggregation, guiding the external text pixels to the internal text kernels. The relaxation operation is integrated into the dense regression for centripetal shifts, allowing the correct prediction in a range instead of a specific value. The convenient reconstruction of text contours and the tolerance of prediction errors in our method guarantee the high detection accuracy and the fast inference speed, respectively. Besides, we shrink our text detector into a proposal generation module, namely CentripetalText Proposal Network (CPN), replacing Segmentation Proposal Network (SPN) in Mask TextSpotter v3 and producing more accurate proposals. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on several commonly used scene text benchmarks, including both curved and multi-oriented text datasets. For the task of scene text detection, our approach achieves superior or competitive performance compared to other existing methods, e.g., F-measure of 86.3% at 40.0 FPS on Total-Text, F-measure of 86.1% at 34.8 FPS on MSRA-TD500, etc. For the task of end-to-end scene text recognition, our method outperforms Mask TextSpotter v3 by 1.1% in F-measure on Total-Text.

    * Authors: Vladimir Braverman, Avinatan Hassidim, Yossi Matias, Mariano Schain, Sandeep Silwal, Samson Zhou
    * Abstract: Robustness against adversarial attacks has recently been at the forefront of algorithmic design for machine learning tasks. In the adversarial streaming model, an adversary gives an algorithm a sequence of adaptively chosen updates $u_1,\ldots,u_n$ as a data stream. The goal of the algorithm is to compute or approximate some predetermined function for every prefix of the adversarial stream, but the adversary may generate future updates based on previous outputs of the algorithm. In particular, the adversary may gradually learn the random bits internally used by an algorithm to manipulate dependencies in the input. This is especially problematic as many important problems in the streaming model require randomized algorithms, as they are known to not admit any deterministic algorithms that use sublinear space. In this paper, we introduce adversarially robust streaming algorithms for central machine learning and algorithmic tasks, such as regression and clustering, as well as their more general counterparts, subspace embedding, low-rank approximation, and coreset construction. For regression and other numerical linear algebra related tasks, we consider the row arrival streaming model. Our results are based on a simple, but powerful, observation that many importance sampling-based algorithms give rise to adversarial robustness which is in contrast to sketching based algorithms, which are very prevalent in the streaming literature but suffer from adversarial attacks. In addition, we show that the well-known merge and reduce paradigm in streaming is adversarially robust. Since the merge and reduce paradigm allows coreset constructions in the streaming setting, we thus obtain robust algorithms for $k$-means, $k$-median, $k$-center, Bregman clustering, projective clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first adversarially robust results for these problems yet require no new algorithmic implementations. Finally, we empirically confirm the robustness of our algorithms on various adversarial attacks and demonstrate that by contrast, some common existing algorithms are not robust.

    * Abstract: Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message-passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message-passing.

    * Abstract: We present an approach to encode a speech signal into a fixed-size representation which minimizes the cosine loss with the existing massively multilingual LASER text embedding space. Sentences are close in this embedding space, independently of their language and modality, either text or audio. Using a similarity metric in that multimodal embedding space, we perform mining of audio in German, French, Spanish and English from Librivox against billions of sentences from Common Crawl. This yielded more than twenty thousand hours of aligned speech translations. To evaluate the automatically mined speech/text corpora, we train neural speech translation systems for several languages pairs. Adding the mined data, achieves significant improvements in the BLEU score on the CoVoST2 and the MUST-C test sets with respect to a very competitive baseline. Our approach can also be used to directly perform speech-to-speech mining, without the need to first transcribe or translate the data. We obtain more than one thousand three hundred hours of aligned speech in French, German, Spanish and English. This speech corpus has the potential to boost research in speech-to-speech translation which suffers from scarcity of natural end-to-end training data. All the mined multimodal corpora will be made freely available.

    * Publication Date: `2021`
    * Authors: Nathaniel Lahn, Sharath Raghvendra, Jiacheng Ye
    * Abstract: Maximum cardinality bipartite matching is an important graph optimization problem with several applications. For instance, maximum cardinality matching in a $\delta$-disc graph can be used in the computation of the bottleneck matching as well as the $\infty$-Wasserstein and the Lévy-Prokhorov distances between probability distributions. For any point sets $A, B \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, the $\delta$-disc graph is a bipartite graph formed by connecting every pair of points $(a,b) \in A\times B$ by an edge if the Euclidean distance between them is at most $\delta$. Using the classical Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, a maximum-cardinality matching on any $\delta$-disc graph can be found in $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time.~\footnote{We use $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ to suppress poly-logarithmic terms in the complexity.} In this paper, we present a simplification of a recent algorithm (Lahn and Raghvendra, JoCG 2021) for the maximum cardinality matching problem and describe how a maximum cardinality matching in a $\delta$-disc graph can be computed asymptotically faster than $O(n^{3/2})$ time for any moderately dense point set. As applications, we show that if $A$ and $B$ are point sets drawn uniformly at random from a unit square, an exact bottleneck matching can be computed in $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ time. On the other hand, experiments suggest that the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm seems to take roughly $\Theta (n^{3/2})$ time for this case. This translates to substantial improvements in execution time for larger inputs.

    * Abstract: The paradigm of differentiable programming has significantly enhanced the scope of machine learning via the judicious use of gradient-based optimization. However, standard differentiable programming methods (such as autodiff) typically require that the machine learning models be differentiable, limiting their applicability. Our goal in this paper is to use a new, principled approach to extend gradient-based optimization to functions well modeled by splines, which encompass a large family of piecewise polynomial models. We derive the form of the (weak) Jacobian of such functions and show that it exhibits a block-sparse structure that can be computed implicitly and efficiently. Overall, we show that leveraging this redesigned Jacobian in the form of a differentiable "layer'' in predictive models leads to improved performance in diverse applications such as image segmentation, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and finite element analysis.

    * Abstract: Random walks are a fundamental primitive used in many machine learning algorithms with several applications in clustering and semi-supervised learning. Despite their relevance, the first efficient parallel algorithm to compute random walks has been introduced very recently (Łącki et al.). Unfortunately their method has a fundamental shortcoming: their algorithm is non-local in that it heavily relies on computing random walks out of all nodes in the input graph, even though in many practical applications one is interested in computing random walks only from a small subset of nodes in the graph. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that overcomes this limitation by building random walks efficiently and locally at the same time. We show that our technique is both memory and round efficient, and in particular yields an efficient parallel local clustering algorithm. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with experimental results showing that our algorithm is significantly more scalable than previous approaches.

    * Abstract: Graph embedding maps a graph into a convenient vector-space representation for graph analysis and machine learning applications. Many graph embedding methods hinge on a sampling of context nodes based on random walks. However, random walks can be a biased sampler due to the structural properties of graphs. Most notably, random walks are biased by the degree of each node, where a node is sampled proportionally to its degree. The implication of such biases has not been clear, particularly in the context of graph representation learning. Here, we investigate the impact of the random walks' bias on graph embedding and propose residual2vec, a general graph embedding method that can debias various structural biases in graphs by using random graphs. We demonstrate that this debiasing not only improves link prediction and clustering performance but also allows us to explicitly model salient structural properties in graph embedding.

    * Authors: OSCAR HERNAN MADRID PADILLA, Yi Yu, Alessandro Rinaldo
    * Abstract: We study piece-wise constant signals corrupted by additive Gaussian noise over a $d$-dimensional lattice. Data of this form naturally arise in a host of applications, and the tasks of signal detection or testing, de-noising and estimation have been studied extensively in the statistical and signal processing literature. In this paper we consider instead the problem of partition recovery, i.e.~of estimating the partition of the lattice induced by the constancy regions of the unknown signal, using the computationally-efficient dyadic classification and regression tree (DCART) methodology proposed by \citep{donoho1997cart}. We prove that, under appropriate regularity conditions on the shape of the partition elements, a DCART-based procedure consistently estimates the underlying partition at a rate of order $\sigma^2 k^* \log (N)/\kappa^2$, where $k^*$ is the minimal number of rectangular sub-graphs obtained using recursive dyadic partitions supporting the signal partition, $\sigma^2$ is the noise variance, $\kappa$ is the minimal magnitude of the signal difference among contiguous elements of the partition and $N$ is the size of the lattice. Furthermore, under stronger assumptions, our method attains a sharper estimation error of order $\sigma^2\log(N)/\kappa^2$, independent of $k^*$, which we show to be minimax rate optimal. Our theoretical guarantees further extend to the partition estimator based on the optimal regression tree estimator (ORT) of \cite{chatterjee2019adaptive} and to the one obtained through an NP-hard exhaustive search method. We corroborate our theoretical findings and the effectiveness of DCART for partition recovery in simulations.

    * Abstract: As annotations of data can be scarce in large-scale practical problems, leveraging unlabelled examples is one of the most important aspects of machine learning. This is the aim of semi-supervised learning. To benefit from the access to unlabelled data, it is natural to diffuse smoothly knowledge of labelled data to unlabelled one. This induces to the use of Laplacian regularization. Yet, current implementations of Laplacian regularization suffer from several drawbacks, notably the well-known curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we design a new class of algorithms overcoming this issue, unveiling a large body of spectral filtering methods. Additionally, we provide a statistical analysis showing that our estimators exhibit desirable behaviors. They are implemented through (reproducing) kernel methods, for which we provide realistic computational guidelines in order to make our method usable with large amounts of data.

    * Abstract: We propose a new approach to learn to segment multiple image objects without manual supervision. The method can extract objects form still images, but uses videos for supervision. While prior works have considered motion for segmentation, a key insight is that, while motion can be used to identify objects, not all objects are necessarily in motion: the absence of motion does not imply the absence of objects. Hence, our model learns to predict image regions that are likely to contain motion patterns characteristic of objects moving rigidly. It does not predict specific motion, which cannot be done unambiguously from a still image, but a distribution of possible motions, which includes the possibility that an object does not move at all. We demonstrate the advantage of this approach over its deterministic counterpart and show state-of-the-art unsupervised object segmentation performance on simulated and real-world benchmarks, surpassing methods that use motion even at test time. As our approach is applicable to variety of network architectures that segment the scenes, we also apply it to existing image reconstruction-based models showing drastic improvement.

    * Authors: Bobak Kiani, Randall Balestriero, Yann LeCun, Seth Lloyd
    * Abstract: In learning with recurrent or very deep feed-forward networks, employing unitary matrices in each layer can be very effective at maintaining long-range stability. However, restricting network parameters to be unitary typically comes at the cost of expensive parameterizations or increased training runtime. We propose instead an efficient method based on rank-$k$ updates -- or their rank-$k$ approximation -- that maintains performance at a nearly optimal training runtime. We introduce two variants of this method, named Direct (projUNN-D) and Tangent (projUNN-T) projected Unitary Neural Networks, that can parameterize full $N$-dimensional unitary or orthogonal matrices with a training runtime scaling as $O(kN^2)$. Our method either projects low-rank gradients onto the closest unitary matrix (projUNN-T) or transports unitary matrices in the direction of the low-rank gradient (projUNN-D). Even in the fastest setting ($k=1$), projUNN is able to train a model's unitary parameters to reach comparable performances against baseline implementations. In recurrent neural network settings, projUNN closely matches or exceeds benchmarked results from prior unitary neural networks. Finally, we preliminarily explore projUNN in training orthogonal convolutional neural networks, which are currently unable to outperform state of the art models but can potentially enhance stability and robustness at large depth.

    * Abstract: We propose a recipe on how to build a general, powerful, scalable (GPS) graph Transformer with linear complexity and state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of benchmarks. Graph Transformers (GTs) have gained popularity in the field of graph representation learning with a variety of recent publications but they lack a common foundation about what constitutes a good positional or structural encoding, and what differentiates them. In this paper, we summarize the different types of encodings with a clearer definition and categorize them as being $\textit{local}$, $\textit{global}$ or $\textit{relative}$. The prior GTs are constrained to small graphs with a few hundred nodes, here we propose the first architecture with a complexity linear in the number of nodes and edges $O(N+E)$ by decoupling the local real-edge aggregation from the fully-connected Transformer. We argue that this decoupling does not negatively affect the expressivity, with our architecture being a universal function approximator on graphs. Our GPS recipe consists of choosing 3 main ingredients: (i) positional/structural encoding, (ii) local message-passing mechanism, and (iii) global attention mechanism. We provide a modular framework $\textit{GraphGPS}$ that supports multiple types of encodings and that provides efficiency and scalability both in small and large graphs. We test our architecture on 16 benchmarks and show highly competitive results in all of them, show-casing the empirical benefits gained by the modularity and the combination of different strategies.

    * Abstract: We prove identifiability of a broad class of deep latent variable models that (a) have universal approximation capabilities and (b) are the decoders of variational autoencoders that are commonly used in practice. Unlike existing work, our analysis does not require weak supervision, auxiliary information, or conditioning in the latent space. Specifically, we show that for a broad class of generative (i.e. unsupervised) models with universal approximation capabilities, the side information $u$ is not necessary: We prove identifiability of the entire generative model where we do not observe $u$ and only observe the data $x$. The models we consider match autoencoder architectures used in practice that leverage mixture priors in the latent space and ReLU/leaky-ReLU activations in the encoder, such as VaDE and MFC-VAE. Our main result is an identifiability hierarchy that significantly generalizes previous work and exposes how different assumptions lead to different ``strengths'' of identifiability, and includes certain ``vanilla'' VAEs with isotropic Gaussian priors as a special case. For example, our weakest result establishes (unsupervised) identifiability up to an affine transformation, and thus partially resolves an open problem regarding model identifiability raised in prior work. These theoretical results are augmented with experiments on both simulated and real data.

    * Abstract: We present Neural Shape Deformation Priors, a novel method for shape manipulation that predicts mesh deformations of non-rigid objects from user-provided handle movements. State-of-the-art methods cast this problem as an optimization task, where the input source mesh is iteratively deformed to minimize an objective function according to hand-crafted regularizers such as ARAP. In this work, we learn the deformation behavior based on the underlying geometric properties of a shape, while leveraging a large-scale dataset containing a diverse set of non-rigid deformations. Specifically, given a source mesh and desired target locations of handles that describe the partial surface deformation, we predict a continuous deformation field that is defined in 3D space to describe the space deformation. To this end, we introduce transformer-based deformation networks that represent a shape deformation as a composition of local surface deformations. It learns a set of local latent codes anchored in 3D space, from which we can learn a set of continuous deformation functions for local surfaces. Our method can be applied to challenging deformations and generalizes well to unseen deformations. We validate our approach in experiments using the DeformingThing4D dataset, and compare to both classic optimization-based and recent neural network-based methods.

    * Abstract: Explaining machine learning models is an important and increasingly popular area of research interest. The Shapley value from game theory has been proposed as a prime approach to compute feature importance towards model predictions on images, text, tabular data, and recently graph neural networks (GNNs) on graphs. In this work, we revisit the appropriateness of the Shapley value for GNN explanation, where the task is to identify the most important subgraph and constituent nodes for GNN predictions. We claim that the Shapley value is a non-ideal choice for graph data because it is by definition not structure-aware. We propose a Graph Structure-aware eXplanation (GStarX) method to leverage the critical graph structure information to improve the explanation. Specifically, we define a scoring function based on a new structure-aware value from the cooperative game theory proposed by Hamiache and Navarro (HN). When used to score node importance, the HN value utilizes graph structures to attribute cooperation surplus between neighbor nodes, resembling message passing in GNNs, so that node importance scores reflect not only the node feature importance, but also the node structural roles. We demonstrate that GStarX produces qualitatively more intuitive explanations, and quantitatively improves explanation fidelity over strong baselines on chemical graph property prediction and text graph sentiment classification.

    * Abstract: In adversarial team games, a team of players sequentially faces a team of adversaries. These games are the simplest setting with multiple players where cooperation and competition coexist, and it is known that the information asymmetry among the team members makes equilibrium approximation computationally hard. Although much effort has been spent designing scalable algorithms, the problem of solving large game instances is open. In this paper, we extend the successful approach of solving huge two-player zero-sum games, where a blueprint strategy is computed offline by using an abstract version of the game and then it is refined online, that is, during a playthrough. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, our paper provides the first method for online strategy refinement via subgame solving in adversarial team games. Our method, based on the team belief DAG, generates a gadget game and then refine the blueprint strategy by using column-generation approaches in anytime fashion. If the blueprint is sparse, then our whole algorithm runs end-to-end in polynomial time given a best-response oracle; in particular, it avoids expanding the whole team belief DAG, which has exponential worst-case size. We apply our method to a standard test suite, and we empirically show the performance improvement of the strategies thanks to subgame solving.

    * Abstract: Autoformalization is the process of automatically translating from natural language mathematics to formal specifications and proofs. A successful autoformalization system could advance the fields of formal verification, program synthesis, and artificial intelligence.While the long-term goal of autoformalization seemed elusive for a long time, we show large language models provide new prospects towards this goal. We make the surprising observation that LLMs can correctly translate a significant portion ($25.3\%$) of mathematical competition problems perfectly to formal specifications in Isabelle/HOL. We demonstrate the usefulness of this process by improving a previously introduced neural theorem prover via training on these autoformalized theorems. Our methodology results in a new state-of-the-art result on the MiniF2F theorem proving benchmark, improving the proof rate from~$29.6\%$ to~$35.2\%$.

    * Abstract: Machine learning on blockchain graphs is an emerging field with many applications such as ransomware payment tracking, price manipulation analysis, and money laundering detection. However, analyzing blockchain data requires domain expertise and computational resources, which pose a significant barrier and hinder advancement in this field. We introduce Chartalist, the first comprehensive platform to methodically access and use machine learning across a large selection of blockchains to address this challenge. Chartalist contains ML-ready datasets from unspent transaction output (UTXO) (e.g., Bitcoin) and account-based blockchains (e.g., Ethereum). We envision that Chartalist can facilitate data modeling, analysis, and representation of blockchain data and attract a wider community of scientists to analyze blockchains. Chartalist is an open-science initiative at https://github.com/cakcora/Chartalist.

    * Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is a challenging task due to the complex local geometric structures of objects in point clouds. In this paper, we propose a learning-based superpoint graph cut method that explicitly learns the local geometric structures of the point cloud for 3D instance segmentation. Specifically, we first oversegment the raw point clouds into superpoints and construct the superpoint graph. Then, we propose an edge score prediction network to predict the edge scores of the superpoint graph, where the similarity vectors of two adjacent nodes learned through cross-graph attention in the coordinate and feature spaces are used for regressing edge scores. By forcing two adjacent nodes of the same instance to be close to the instance center in the coordinate and feature spaces, we formulate a geometry-aware edge loss to train the edge score prediction network. Finally, we develop a superpoint graph cut network that employs the learned edge scores and the predicted semantic classes of nodes to generate instances, where bilateral graph attention is proposed to extract discriminative features on both the coordinate and feature spaces for predicting semantic labels and scores of instances. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, ScanNet v2 and S3DIS, show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 3D instance segmentation.

    * Abstract: Causal identification is at the core of the causal inference literature, where complete algorithms have been proposed to identify causal queries of interest. The validity of these algorithms hinges on the restrictive assumption of having access to a correctly specified causal structure. In this work, we study the setting where a probabilistic model of the causal structure is available. Specifically, the edges in a causal graph exist with uncertainties which may, for example, represent degree of belief from domain experts. Alternatively, the uncertainty about an edge may reflect the confidence of a particular statistical test. The question that naturally arises in this setting is: Given such a probabilistic graph and a specific causal effect of interest, what is the subgraph which has the highest plausibility and for which the causal effect is identifiable? We show that answering this question reduces to solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem which we call the edge ID problem. We propose efficient algorithms to approximate this problem and evaluate them against both real-world networks and randomly generated graphs.

    * Authors: Oleg Platonov, Denis Kuznedelev, Artem Babenko, Liudmila Prokhorenkova
    * Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.

    * Publisher: NeurIPS
    * Publication Date: `2023`
    * Authors: Joon-Hyeok Yim, Anna Gilbert
    * Abstract: Building trees to represent or to fit distances is a critical component of phylogenetic analysis, metric embeddings, approximation algorithms, geometric graph neural nets, and the analysis of hierarchical data. Much of the previous algorithmic work, however, has focused on generic metric spaces (i.e., those with no \emph{a priori} constraints). Leveraging several ideas from the mathematical analysis of hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory, we study the tree fitting problem as finding the relation between the hyperbolicity (ultrametricity) vector and the error of tree (ultrametric) embedding. That is, we define a vector of hyperbolicity (ultrametric) values over all triples of points and compare the $\ell_p$ norms of this vector with the $\ell_q$ norm of the distortion of the best tree fit to the distances. This formulation allows us to define the average hyperbolicity (ultrametricity) in terms of a normalized $\ell_1$ norm of the hyperbolicity vector. Furthermore, we can interpret the classical tree fitting result of Gromov as a $p = q = \infty$ result. We present an algorithm \textsc{HCCRootedTreeFit} such that the $\ell_1$ error of the output embedding is analytically bounded in terms of the $\ell_1$-norm of the hyperbolicity vector (i.e., $p = q = 1$) and that this result is tight. Furthermore, this algorithm has significantly different theoretical and empirical performance as compared to Gromov's result and related algorithms. Finally, we show using \textsc{HCCRootedTreeFit} and related tree fitting algorithms, that supposedly standard data sets for hierarchical data analysis and geometric graph neural networks have radically different tree fits than those of synthetic, truly tree-like data sets, suggesting that a much more refined analysis of these standard data sets is called for.

    * Abstract: Machine learning for point clouds has been attracting much attention, with many applications in various fields, such as shape recognition and material science. For enhancing the accuracy of such machine learning methods, it is often effective to incorporate global topological features, which are typically extracted by persistent homology. In the calculation of persistent homology for a point cloud, we choose a filtration for the point cloud, an increasing sequence of spaces. Since the performance of machine learning methods combined with persistent homology is highly affected by the choice of a filtration, we need to tune it depending on data and tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework that learns a filtration adaptively with the use of neural networks. In order to make the resulting persistent homology isometry-invariant, we develop a neural network architecture with such invariance. Additionally, we show a theoretical result on a finite-dimensional approximation of filtration functions, which justifies the proposed network architecture. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our framework in several classification tasks.

    * Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performances in various applications. However, GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in graphs due to oversmoothing. In this paper, we generalize the concept of oversmoothing from undirected to directed graphs. To this aim, we extend the notion of Dirichlet energy by considering a directed symmetrically normalized Laplacian. As vanilla graph convolutional networks are prone to oversmooth, we adopt a neural graph ODE framework. Specifically, we propose fractional graph Laplacian neural ODEs, which describe non-local dynamics. We prove that our approach allows propagating information between distant nodes while maintaining a low probability of long-distance jumps. Moreover, we show that our method is more flexible with respect to the convergence of the graph’s Dirichlet energy, thereby mitigating oversmoothing. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs, both directed and undirected, demonstrating our method’s versatility across diverse graph homophily levels.

    * Abstract: Node-level random walk has been widely used to improve Graph Neural Networks. However, there is limited attention to random walk on edge and, more generally, on $k$-simplices. This paper systematically analyzes how random walk on different orders of simplicial complexes (SC) facilitates GNNs in their theoretical expressivity. First, on $0$-simplices or node level, we establish a connection between existing positional encoding (PE) and structure encoding (SE) methods through the bridge of random walk. Second, on $1$-simplices or edge level, we bridge edge-level random walk and Hodge $1$-Laplacians and design corresponding edge PE respectively. In spatial domain, we directly make use of edge level random walk to construct EdgeRWSE. Based on spectral analysis of Hodge $1$-Laplcians, we propose Hodge1Lap, a permutation equivariant and expressive edge-level positional encoding. Third, we generalize our theory to random walk on higher-order simplices and propose the general principle to design PE on simplices based on random walk and Hodge Laplacians. Inter-level random walk is also introduced to unify a wide range of simplicial networks. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our random walk-based methods.

    * Abstract: This paper studies structured node classification on graphs, where the predictions should consider dependencies between the node labels. In particular, we focus on solving the problem for partially labeled graphs where it is essential to incorporate the information in the known label for predicting the unknown labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework leveraging the diffusion probabilistic model for structured node classification (DPM-SNC). At the heart of our framework is the extraordinary capability of DPM-SNC to (a) learn a joint distribution over the labels with an expressive reverse diffusion process and (b) make predictions conditioned on the known labels utilizing manifold-constrained sampling. Since the DPMs lack training algorithms for partially labeled data, we design a novel training algorithm to apply DPMs, maximizing a new variational lower bound. We also theoretically analyze how DPMs benefit node classification by enhancing the expressive power of GNNs based on proposing AGG-WL, which is strictly more powerful than the classic 1-WL test. We extensively verify the superiority of our DPM-SNC in diverse scenarios, which include not only the transductive setting on partially labeled graphs but also the inductive setting and unlabeled graphs.

    * Abstract: We study the multi-objective minimum weight base problem, an abstraction of classical NP-hard combinatorial problems such as the multi-objective minimum spanning tree problem. We prove some important properties of the convex hull of the non-dominated front, such as its approximation quality and an upper bound on the number of extreme points. Using these properties, we give the first run-time analysis of the MOEA/D algorithm for this problem, an evolutionary algorithm that effectively optimizes by decomposing the objectives into single-objective components. We show that the MOEA/D, given an appropriate decomposition setting, finds all extreme points within expected fixed-parameter polynomial time, in the oracle model. Experiments are conducted on random bi-objective minimum spanning tree instances, and the results agree with our theoretical findings. Furthermore, compared with a previously studied evolutionary algorithm for the problem GSEMO, MOEA/D finds all extreme points much faster across all instances.

    * Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction tasks. However, their performance suffers under challenging scenarios with sparse input views. We present CorresNeRF, a novel method that leverages image correspondence priors computed by off-the-shelf methods to supervise NeRF training. We design adaptive processes for augmentation and filtering to generate dense and high-quality correspondences. The correspondences are then used to regularize NeRF training via the correspondence pixel reprojection and depth loss terms. We evaluate our methods on novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction tasks with density-based and SDF-based NeRF models on different datasets. Our method outperforms previous methods in both photometric and geometric metrics. We show that this simple yet effective technique of using correspondence priors can be applied as a plug-and-play module across different NeRF variants.

    * Abstract: What is a useful skill hierarchy for an autonomous agent? We propose an answer based on a graphical representation of how the interaction between an agent and its environment may unfold. Our approach uses modularity maximisation as a central organising principle to expose the structure of the interaction graph at multiple levels of abstraction. The result is a collection of skills that operate at varying time scales, organised into a hierarchy, where skills that operate over longer time scales are composed of skills that operate over shorter time scales. The entire skill hierarchy is generated automatically, with no human input, including the skills themselves (their behaviour, when they can be called, and when they terminate) as well as the dependency structure between them. In a wide range of environments, this approach generates skill hierarchies that are intuitively appealing and that considerably improve the learning performance of the agent.

    * Abstract: Reductive Lie Groups, such as the orthogonal groups, the Lorentz group, or the unitary groups, play essential roles across scientific fields as diverse as high energy physics, quantum mechanics, quantum chromodynamics, molecular dynamics, computer vision, and imaging. In this paper, we present a general Equivariant Neural Network architecture capable of respecting the symmetries of the finite-dimensional representations of any reductive Lie Group. Our approach generalizes the successful ACE and MACE architectures for atomistic point clouds to any data equivariant to a reductive Lie group action. We also introduce the lie-nn software library, which provides all the necessary tools to develop and implement such general G-equivariant neural networks. It implements routines for the reduction of generic tensor products of representations into irreducible representations, making it easy to apply our architecture to a wide range of problems and groups. The generality and performance of our approach are demonstrated by applying it to the tasks of top quark decay tagging (Lorentz group) and shape recognition (orthogonal group).

Specifically, we first leverage recent results on non-linear ICA to show that causal models are identifiable from observational data given a causal ordering, and thus can be recovered using autoregressive normalizing flows (NFs). Second, we analyze different design and learning choices for causal normalizing flows to capture the underlying causal data-generating process. Third, we describe how to implement the do-operator in causal NFs, and thus, how to answer interventional and counterfactual questions. Finally, in our experiments, we validate our design and training choices through a comprehensive ablation study; compare causal NFs to other approaches for approximating causal models; and empirically demonstrate that causal NFs can be used to address real-world problems—where the presence of mixed discrete-continuous data and partial knowledge on the causal graph is the norm.

    * Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) provides topological descriptors for geometric data, such as weighted graphs, which are interpretable, stable to perturbations, and invariant under, e.g., relabeling. Most applications of PH focus on the one-parameter case---where the descriptors summarize the changes in topology of data as it is filtered by a single quantity of interest---and there is now a wide array of methods enabling the use of one-parameter PH descriptors in data science, which rely on the stable vectorization of these descriptors as elements of a Hilbert space. Although the multiparameter PH (MPH) of data that is filtered by several quantities of interest encodes much richer information than its one-parameter counterpart, the scarceness of stability results for MPH descriptors has so far limited the available options for the stable vectorization of MPH. In this paper, we aim to bring together the best of both worlds by showing how the interpretation of signed barcodes---a recent family of MPH descriptors---as signed Radon measures leads to natural extensions of vectorization strategies from one parameter to multiple parameters. The resulting feature vectors are easy to define and to compute, and provably stable. While, as a proof of concept, we focus on simple choices of signed barcodes and vectorizations, we already see notable performance improvements when comparing our feature vectors to state-of-the-art topology-based methods on various types of data.

    * Abstract: We systematically investigate graph transformations that enable standard message passing to simulate state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) without loss of expressivity. Using these, many state-of-the-art GNNs can be implemented with message passing operations from standard libraries, eliminating many sources of implementation issues and allowing for better code optimization. We distinguish between weak and strong simulation: weak simulation achieves the same expressivity only after several message passing steps while strong simulation achieves this after every message passing step. Our contribution leads to a direct way to translate common operations of non-standard GNNs to graph transformations that allow for strong or weak simulation. Our empirical evaluation shows competitive predictive performance of message passing on transformed graphs for various molecular benchmark datasets, in several cases surpassing the original GNNs.

    * Abstract: A number of scene text in natural images have irregular shapes which often cause significant difficulties for a text detector. In this paper, we propose a robust scene text detection method based on a parameterized shape modeling and regression scheme for text with arbitrary shapes. The shape model geometrically depicts a text region with a polynomial centerline and a series of width cues to capture global shape characteristics (e.g. smoothness) and local shapes of the text respectively for accurate text localization, which differs from previous text region modeling schemes based on discrete boundary points or pixels. We further propose a text detection network PolyPRNet equipped with an iterative regression module for text's shape parameters, which effectively enhances the detection accuracy of arbitrary-shaped text. Our method achieves state-of-the-art text detection results on several standard benchmarks.

In this paper, from a set of 2D input images, we create a monolithic mesh, representing a physical 3D Lego model as input, and split it in to its known components such that the output of the program can be used to completely reconstruct the input model, brick for brick. We present a novel, fully automatic pipeline to reconstruct Lego models in 3D from 2D images; A-DBSCAN, an angular variant of DBSCAN, useful for grouping both parallel and anti-parallel vectors; and a method for reducing the problem of non-Manhattan reconstruction to that of Manhattan reconstruction. We evaluate the presented approach both qualitatively and quantitatively on a set of Lego duck models from a public data set, and show that the algorithm is able to identify and reconstruct the Lego models successfully.

    * Abstract: Word spotting helps people like archaeologists, historian and internet censors to retrieve regions of interest from document images according to the queries defined by them. However, words in handwritten historical document images are generally densely distributed and have many overlapping strokes, which make it challenging to apply word spotting in such scenarios. Recently, deep learning based methods have achieved significant performance improvement, which usually adopt two-stage object detectors to produce word segmentation results and then embed cropped word regions into a word embedding space. Different from these multi-stage methods, this paper presents an effective end-to-end trainable method for segmentation-free query-by-string word spotting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses a single network to simultaneously predict word bounding box and word embedding in only one stage by adopting feature sharing and multi-task learning strategy. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art segmentation-free methods.

    * Abstract: We present Eyecandies, a novel synthetic dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. Photo-realistic images of procedurally generated candies are rendered in a controlled environment under multiple lightning conditions, also providing depth and normal maps in an industrial conveyor scenario. We make available anomaly-free samples for model training and validation, while anomalous instances with precise ground-truth annotations are provided only in the test set. The dataset comprises ten classes of candies, each showing different challenges, such as complex textures, self-occlusions and specularities. Furthermore, we achieve large intra-class variation by randomly drawing key parameters of a procedural rendering pipeline, which enables the creation of an arbitrary number of instances with photo-realistic appearance. Likewise, anomalies are injected into the rendering graph and pixel-wise annotations are automatically generated, overcoming human-biases and possible inconsistencies. We believe this dataset may encourage the exploration of original approaches to solve the anomaly detection task, e.g. by combining color, depth and normal maps, as they are not provided by most of the existing datasets. Indeed, in order to demonstrate how exploiting additional information may actually lead to higher detection performance, we show the results obtained by training a deep convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct different combinations of inputs.

    * Abstract: Large-scale, multimodal models trained on web data such as OpenAI's CLIP are becoming the foundation of many applications. Yet, they are also more complex to understand, test, and therefore align with human values. In this paper, we propose gScoreCAM--a state-of-the-art method for visualizing the main objects that CLIP is looking at in an image. On zero-shot object detection, gScoreCAM performs similarly to ScoreCAM, the best prior art on CLIP, yet 8 to 10 times faster. Our method outperforms other existing, well-known methods (HilaCAM, RISE, and the entire CAM family) by a large margin, especially in multi-object scenes. gScoreCAM sub-samples k = 300 channels (from 3,072 channels--i.e. reducing complexity by almost 10 times) of the highest gradients and linearly combines them into a final "attention" visualization. We demonstrate the utility and superiority of our method on three datasets: ImageNet, COCO, and PartImageNet. Our work opens up interesting future directions in understanding and de-biasing CLIP.

    * Abstract: In this work we present two video test data sets for the novel computer vision (CV) task of out of distribution tracking (OOD tracking). Here, OOD objects are understood as objects with a semantic class outside the semantic space of an underlying image segmentation algorithm, or an instance within the semantic space which however looks decisively different from the instances contained in the training data. OOD objects occurring on video sequences should be detected on single frames as early as possible and tracked over their time of appearance as long as possible. During the time of appearance, they should be segmented as precisely as possible. We present the SOS data set containing 20 video sequences of street scenes and more than 1000 labeled frames with up to two OOD objects. We furthermore publish the synthetic CARLA-WildLife data set that consists of 26 video sequences containing up to four OOD objects on a single frame. We propose metrics to measure the success of OOD tracking and develop a baseline algorithm that efficiently tracks the OOD objects. As an application that benefits from OOD tracking, we retrieve OOD sequences from unlabeled videos of street scenes containing OOD objects.

    * Abstract: Developing effective scene text detection and recognition models hinges on extensive training data, which can be both laborious and costly to obtain, especially for low-resourced languages. Conventional methods tailored for Latin characters often falter with non-Latin scripts due to challenges like character stacking, diacritics, and variable character widths without clear word boundaries. In this paper, we introduce the first Khmer scene-text dataset, featuring 1,544 expert-annotated images, including 997 indoor and 547 outdoor scenes. This diverse dataset includes flat text, raised text, poorly illuminated text, distant and partially obscured text. Annotations provide line-level text and polygonal bounding box coordinates for each scene.The benchmark includes baseline models for scene-text detection and recognition tasks, providing a robust starting point for future research endeavors. The KhmerST dataset is publicly accessible.

    * Abstract: Enabling engagement of manga by visually impaired individuals presents a significant challenge due to its inherently visual nature. With the goal of fostering accessibility, this paper aims to generate a dialogue transcript of a complete manga chapter, entirely automatically, with a particular emphasis on ensuring narrative consistency. This entails identifying (i) what is being said, i.e., detecting the texts on each page and classifying them into essential vs non-essential, and (ii) who is saying it, i.e., attributing each dialogue to its speaker, while ensuring the same characters are named consistently throughout the chapter. To this end, we introduce: (i) Magiv2, a model that is capable of generating high-quality chapter-wide manga transcripts with named characters and significantly higher precision in speaker diarisation over prior works; (ii) an extension of the PopManga evaluation dataset, which now includes annotations for speech-bubble tail boxes, associations of text to corresponding tails, classifications of text as essential or non-essential, and the identity for each character box; and (iii) a new character bank dataset, which comprises over 2.2K principal characters from 64 manga series, featuring an average of 6.8 exemplar images per character, as well as a list of chapters in which they appear. The code, trained model, and both datasets will be made publicly available.

    * Publication Date: `2024`
    * Authors: Fariborz Taherkhani, Ehsan Kazemi
    * Abstract: We propose a new framework for Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD), a domain that traditionally relies on image-level labels. In addressing the inherent limitations of current WSOD methods, particularly their reliance on image-level annotations that result in inaccurate bounding box selections, we develop a framework that iteratively utilizes weak supervision and refines it to progressively enhance the supervision of the object detector throughout the training process. Specifically, we employ the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate initial pseudo-labels bounding boxes from the point prompts generated by Class Activation Mapping (CAM). Our approach tackles the challenge of label noise, where pseudo-labels bounding boxes might only capture parts of objects. We enhance our ability to distinguish between complete and partial detected objects by leveraging an instance-dependent, particularly part-based noise correction model. Our method is inspired by learning methods focusing on part-based representations for object detection and recognition, as well as from human perception, which typically simplifies complex visual information into simpler, constituent parts. Our experiments, conducted in various settings beyond WSOD, including Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) and Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation (WSIS), validate the efficacy of our approach.

    * Publication Date: `2013`
    * Authors: Anelia Angelova, Shenghuo Zhu
    * Abstract: We propose a detection and segmentation algorithm for the purposes of fine-grained recognition. The algorithm first detects low-level regions that could potentially belong to the object and then performs a full-object segmentation through propagation. Apart from segmenting the object, we can also 'zoom in' on the object, i.e. center it, normalize it for scale, and thus discount the effects of the background. We then show that combining this with a state-of-the-art classification algorithm leads to significant improvements in performance especially for datasets which are considered particularly hard for recognition, e.g. birds species. The proposed algorithm is much more efficient than other known methods in similar scenarios [4, 21]. Our method is also simpler and we apply it here to different classes of objects, e.g. birds, flowers, cats and dogs. We tested the algorithm on a number of benchmark datasets for fine-grained categorization. It outperforms all the known state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, sometimes by as much as 11%. It improves the performance of our baseline algorithm by 3-4%, consistently on all datasets. We also observed more than a 4% improvement in the recognition performance on a challenging largescale flower dataset, containing 578 species of flowers and 250,000 images.

    * Authors: Carlos Arteta, Victor Lempitsky, J. A. Noble, Andrew Zisserman
    * Abstract: The objective of this work is to detect all instances of a class (such as cells or people) in an image. The instances may be partially overlapping and clustered, and hence quite challenging for traditional detectors, which aim at localizing individual instances. Our approach is to propose a set of candidate regions, and then select regions based on optimizing a global classification score, subject to the constraint that the selected regions are non-overlapping. Our novel contribution is to extend standard object detection by introducing separate classes for tuples of objects into the detection process. For example, our detector can pick a region containing two or three object instances, while assigning such region an appropriate label. We show that this formulation can be learned within the structured output SVM framework, and that the inference in such model can be accomplished using dynamic programming on a tree structured region graph. Furthermore, the learning only requires weak annotations a dot on each instance. The improvement resulting from the addition of the capability to detect tuples of objects is demonstrated on quite disparate data sets: fluorescence microscopy images and UCSD pedestrians.

    * Abstract: Current pedestrian tracking approaches ignore important aspects of human behavior. Humans are not moving independently, but they closely interact with their environment, which includes not only other persons, but also different scene objects. Typical everyday scenarios include people moving in groups, pushing child strollers, or pulling luggage. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach for classifying such person-object interactions, associating objects to persons, and predicting how the interaction will most likely continue. Our approach relies on stereo depth information in order to track all scene objects in 3D, while simultaneously building up their 3D shape models. These models and their relative spatial arrangement are then fed into a probabilistic graphical model which jointly infers pairwise interactions and object classes. The inferred interactions can then be used to support tracking by recovering lost object tracks. We evaluate our approach on a novel dataset containing more than 15,000 frames of personobject interactions in 325 video sequences and demonstrate good performance in challenging real-world scenarios.

    * Abstract: In this paper we propose a new technique for learning a discriminative codebook for local feature descriptors, specifically designed for scalable landmark classification. The key contribution lies in exploiting the knowledge of correspondences within sets of feature descriptors during codebook learning. Feature correspondences are obtained using structure from motion (SfM) computation on Internet photo collections which serve as the training data. Our codebook is defined by a random forest that is trained to map corresponding feature descriptors into identical codes. Unlike prior forest-based codebook learning methods, we utilize fine-grained descriptor labels and address the challenge of training a forest with an extremely large number of labels. Our codebook is used with various existing feature encoding schemes and also a variant we propose for importanceweighted aggregation of local features. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of 25 landmarks and our new dataset of 620 landmarks (614K images). Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in landmark classification. Furthermore, our method is memory efficient and scalable.

We consider four novel metrics to quantify performance of a temporal superpixel representation and demonstrate superior performance when compared to supervoxel methods.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we consider the weighted graph matching problem with partially disclosed correspondences between a number of anchor nodes. Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on randomly generated graphs and on two widelyused image sequences, when compared with other existing signature and adjacency matrix based graph matching methods.

    * Abstract: In this paper we present an inference procedure for the semantic segmentation of images. Different from many CRF approaches that rely on dependencies modeled with unary and pairwise pixel or superpixel potentials, our method is entirely based on estimates of the overlap between each of a set of mid-level object segmentation proposals and the objects present in the image. We define continuous latent variables on superpixels obtained by multiple intersections of segments, then output the optimal segments from the inferred superpixel statistics. The algorithm is capable of recombine and refine initial mid-level proposals, as well as handle multiple interacting objects, even from the same class, all in a consistent joint inference framework by maximizing the composite likelihood of the underlying statistical model using an EM algorithm. In the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge, the proposed approach obtains high accuracy and successfully handles images of complex object interactions.

    * Abstract: We propose an integer programming method for estimating the instantaneous count of pedestrians crossing a line of interest in a video sequence. Through a line sampling process, the video is first converted into a temporal slice image. Next, the number of people is estimated in a set of overlapping sliding windows on the temporal slice image, using a regression function that maps from local features to a count. Given that count in a sliding window is the sum of the instantaneous counts in the corresponding time interval, an integer programming method is proposed to recover the number of pedestrians crossing the line of interest in each frame. Integrating over a specific time interval yields the cumulative count of pedestrian crossing the line. Compared with current methods for line counting, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging crowd video datasets.

    * Abstract: This paper tackles the supervised evaluation of image segmentation algorithms. First, it surveys and structures the measures used to compare the segmentation results with a ground truth database; and proposes a new measure: the precision-recall for objects and parts. To compare the goodness of these measures, it defines three quantitative meta-measures involving six state of the art segmentation methods. The meta-measures consist in assuming some plausible hypotheses about the results and assessing how well each measure reflects these hypotheses. As a conclusion, this paper proposes the precision-recall curves for boundaries and for objects-and-parts as the tool of choice for the supervised evaluation of image segmentation. We make the datasets and code of all the measures publicly available.

The system combines region-level features with per-exemplar sliding window detectors. Per-exemplar detectors are better suited for our parsing task than traditional bounding box detectors: they perform well on classes with little training data and high intra-class variation, and they allow object masks to be transferred into the test image for pixel-level segmentation. The proposed system achieves state-of-theart accuracy on three challenging datasets, the largest of which contains 45,676 images and 232 labels.

    * Abstract: Recognizing the category of a visual object remains a challenging computer vision problem. In this paper we develop a novel deep learning method that facilitates examplebased visual object category recognition. Our deep learning architecture consists of multiple stacked layers and computes an intermediate representation that can be fed to a nearest-neighbor classifier. This intermediate representation is discriminative and structure-preserving. It is also capable of extracting essential characteristics shared by objects in the same category while filtering out nonessential differences among them. Each layer in our model is a nonlinear mapping, whose parameters are learned through two sequential steps that are designed to achieve the aforementioned properties. The first step computes a discrete mapping called supervised Laplacian Eigenmap. The second step computes a continuous mapping from the discrete version through nonlinear regression. We have extensively tested our method and it achieves state-of-the-art recognition rates on a number of benchmark datasets.

This assumption is applicable to all scene categories and poses useful constraints for the plausible interpretations (parses) in scene understanding. Our method consists of two major steps: 1) geometric reasoning: recovering solid 3D volumetric primitives from defective point cloud; and 2) physical reasoning: grouping the unstable primitives to physically stable objects by optimizing the stability and the scene prior. We propose to use a novel disconnectivity graph (DG) to represent the energy landscape and use a Swendsen-Wang Cut (MCMC) method for optimization. In experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithm achieves substantially better performance for i) object segmentation, ii) 3D volumetric recovery of the scene, and iii) better parsing result for scene understanding in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in both public dataset and our own new dataset.

    * Abstract: We propose a unified approach for bottom-up hierarchical image segmentation and object candidate generation for recognition, called Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping (MCG). For this purpose, we first develop a fast normalized cuts algorithm. We then propose a high-performance hierarchical segmenter that makes effective use of multiscale information. Finally, we propose a grouping strategy that combines our multiscale regions into highly-accurate object candidates by exploring efficiently their combinatorial space. We conduct extensive experiments on both the BSDS500 and on the PASCAL 2012 segmentation datasets, showing that MCG produces state-of-the-art contours, hierarchical regions and object candidates.

    * Abstract: We propose a purely geometric correspondence-free approach to urban geo-localization using 3D point-ray features extracted from the Digital Elevation Map of an urban environment. We derive a novel formulation for estimating the camera pose locus using 3D-to-2D correspondence of a single point and a single direction alone. We show how this allows us to compute putative correspondences between building corners in the DEM and the query image by exhaustively combining pairs of point-ray features. Then, we employ the two-point method to estimate both the camera pose and compute correspondences between buildings in the DEM and the query image. Finally, we show that the computed camera poses can be efficiently ranked by a simple skyline projection step using building edges from the DEM. Our experimental evaluation illustrates the promise of a purely geometric approach to the urban geo-localization problem.

    * Abstract: We present a tool for re-ranking the results of a specific query by considering the (n+1) × (n+1) matrix of pairwise similarities among the elements of the set of n retrieved results and the query itself. The re-ranking thus makes use of the similarities between the various results and does not employ additional sources of information. The tool is based on graphical Bayesian models, which reinforce retrieved items strongly linked to other retrievals, and on repeated clustering to measure the stability of the obtained associations. The utility of the tool is demonstrated within the context of visual search of documents from the Cairo Genizah and for retrieval of paintings by the same artist and in the same style.

    * Abstract: Labeling large-scale datasets with very accurate object segmentations is an elaborate task that requires a high degree of quality control and a budget of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Thus, developing solutions that can automatically perform the labeling given only weak supervision is key to reduce this cost. In this paper, we show how to exploit 3D information to automatically generate very accurate object segmentations given annotated 3D bounding boxes. We formulate the problem as the one of inference in a binary Markov random field which exploits appearance models, stereo and/or noisy point clouds, a repository of 3D CAD models as well as topological constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of autonomous driving, and show that we can segment cars with the accuracy of 86% intersection-over-union, performing as well as highly recommended MTurkers!

    * Abstract: This paper addresses the large-scale visual font recognition (VFR) problem, which aims at automatic identification of the typeface, weight, and slope of the text in an image or photo without any knowledge of content. Although visual font recognition has many practical applications, it has largely been neglected by the vision community. To address the VFR problem, we construct a large-scale dataset containing 2,420 font classes, which easily exceeds the scale of most image categorization datasets in computer vision. As font recognition is inherently dynamic and open-ended, i.e., new classes and data for existing categories are constantly added to the database over time, we propose a scalable solution based on the nearest class mean classifier (NCM). The core algorithm is built on local feature embedding, local feature metric learning and max-margin template selection, which is naturally amenable to NCM and thus to such open-ended classification problems. The new algorithm can generalize to new classes and new data at little added cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective on our synthetic test images, and achieves promising results on real world test images.

    * Abstract: We use weakly supervised structured learning to track and disambiguate the identity of multiple indistinguishable, translucent and deformable objects that can overlap for many frames. For this challenging problem, we propose a novel model which handles occlusions, complex motions and non-rigid deformations by jointly optimizing the flows of multiple latent intensities across frames. These flows are latent variables for which the user cannot directly provide labels. Instead, we leverage a structured learning formulation that uses weak user annotations to find the best hyperparameters of this model. The approach is evaluated on a challenging dataset for the tracking of multiple Drosophila larvae which we make publicly available. Our method tracks multiple larvae in spite of their poor distinguishability and minimizes the number of identity switches during prolonged mutual occlusion.

    * Abstract: We consider the design of a single vector representation for an image that embeds and aggregates a set of local patch descriptors such as SIFT. More specifically we aim to construct a dense representation, like the Fisher Vector or VLAD, though of small or intermediate size. We make two contributions, both aimed at regularizing the individual contributions of the local descriptors in the final representation. The first is a novel embedding method that avoids the dependency on absolute distances by encoding directions. The second contribution is a "democratization" strategy that further limits the interaction of unrelated descriptors in the aggregation stage. These methods are complementary and give a substantial performance boost over the state of the art in image search with short or mid-size vectors, as demonstrated by our experiments on standard public image retrieval benchmarks.

    * Abstract: We present a practical framework to automatically detect shadows in real world scenes from a single photograph. Previous works on shadow detection put a lot of effort in designing shadow variant and invariant hand-crafted features. In contrast, our framework automatically learns the most relevant features in a supervised manner using multiple convolutional deep neural networks (ConvNets). The 7-layer network architecture of each ConvNet consists of alternating convolution and sub-sampling layers. The proposed framework learns features at the super-pixel level and along the object boundaries. In both cases, features are extracted using a context aware window centered at interest points. The predicted posteriors based on the learned features are fed to a conditional random field model to generate smooth shadow contours. Our proposed framework consistently performed better than the state-of-the-art on all major shadow databases collected under a variety of conditions.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a framework for object recognition using topological persistence. In particular, we show that the so-called persistence diagrams built from functions defined on the objects can serve as compact and informative descriptors for images and shapes. Complementary to the bag-of-features representation, which captures the distribution of values of a given function, persistence diagrams can be used to characterize its structural properties, reflecting spatial information in an invariant way. In practice, the choice of function is simple: each dimension of the feature vector can be viewed as a function. The proposed method is general: it can work on various multimedia data, including 2D shapes, textures and triangle meshes. Extensive experiments on 3D shape retrieval, hand gesture recognition and texture classification demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our approach yields higher recognition accuracy when used in conjunction with the bag-of-features.

    * Authors: Xiaobai Liu, Yibiao Zhao, Song-Chun Zhu
    * Abstract: In this paper, we present an attributed grammar for parsing man-made outdoor scenes into semantic surfaces, and recovering its 3D model simultaneously. The grammar takes superpixels as its terminal nodes and use five production rules to generate the scene into a hierarchical parse graph. Each graph node actually correlates with a surface or a composite of surfaces in the 3D world or the 2D image. They are described by attributes for the global scene model, e.g. focal length, vanishing points, or the surface properties, e.g. surface normal, contact line with other surfaces, and relative spatial location etc. Each production rule is associated with some equations that constraint the attributes of the parent nodes and those of their children nodes. Given an input image, our goal is to construct a hierarchical parse graph by recursively applying the five grammar rules while preserving the attributes constraints. We develop an effective top-down/bottom-up cluster sampling procedure which can explore this constrained space efficiently. We evaluate our method on both public benchmarks and newly built datasets, and achieve state-of-the-art performances in terms of layout estimation and region segmentation. We also demonstrate that our method is able to recover detailed 3D model with relaxed Manhattan structures which clearly advances the state-of-the-arts of singleview 3D reconstruction.

    * Authors: Tuan Anh Ngo, Gustavo Carneiro
    * Abstract: We propose a new fully automated non-rigid segmentation approach based on the distance regularized level set method that is initialized and constrained by the results of a structured inference using deep belief networks. This recently proposed level-set formulation achieves reasonably accurate results in several segmentation problems, and has the advantage of eliminating periodic re-initializations during the optimization process, and as a result it avoids numerical errors. Nevertheless, when applied to challenging problems, such as the left ventricle segmentation from short axis cine magnetic ressonance (MR) images, the accuracy obtained by this distance regularized level set is lower than the state of the art. The main reasons behind this lower accuracy are the dependence on good initial guess for the level set optimization and on reliable appearance models. We address these two issues with an innovative structured inference using deep belief networks that produces reliable initial guess and appearance model. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the MICCAI 2009 left ventricle segmentation challenge, where we show that our approach achieves one of the most competitive results (in terms of segmentation accuracy) in the field.

To our knowledge, it is the first system that achieves such robustness, accuracy, and speed simultaneously, as verified on challenging real data. Our system is made of several novel techniques. We model a hand simply using a number of spheres and define a fast cost function. Those are critical for realtime performance. We propose a hybrid method that combines gradient based and stochastic optimization methods to achieve fast convergence and good accuracy. We present new finger detection and hand initialization methods that greatly enhance the robustness of tracking.

    * Abstract: This paper attempts to address the problem of recognizing human actions while training and testing on distinct datasets, when test videos are neither labeled nor available during training. In this scenario, learning of a joint vocabulary, or domain transfer techniques are not applicable. We first explore reasons for poor classifier performance when tested on novel datasets, and quantify the effect of scene backgrounds on action representations and recognition. Using only the background features and partitioning of gist feature space, we show that the background scenes in recent datasets are quite discriminative and can be used classify an action with reasonable accuracy. We then propose a new process to obtain a measure of confidence in each pixel of the video being a foreground region, using motion, appearance, and saliency together in a 3D MRF based framework. We also propose multiple ways to exploit the foreground confidence: to improve bag-of-words vocabulary, histogram representation of a video, and a novel histogram decomposition based representation and kernel. We used these foreground confidences to recognize actions trained on one data set and test on a different data set. We have performed extensive experiments on several datasets that improve cross dataset recognition accuracy as compared to baseline methods.

    * Abstract: We examine the problem of retrieving high resolution textures of objects observed in multiple videos under small object deformations. In the monocular case, the data redundancy necessary to reconstruct a high-resolution image stems from temporal accumulation. This has been vastly explored and is known as image super-resolution. On the other hand, a handful of methods have considered the texture of a static 3D object observed from several cameras, where the data redundancy is obtained through the different viewpoints. We introduce a unified framework to leverage both possibilities for the estimation of an object's high resolution texture. This framework uniformly deals with any related geometric variability introduced by the acquisition chain or by the evolution over time. To this goal we use 2D warps for all viewpoints and all temporal frames and a linear image formation model from texture to image space. Despite its simplicity, the method is able to successfully handle different views over space and time. As shown experimentally, it demonstrates the interest of temporal information to improve the texture quality. Additionally, we also show that our method outperforms state of the art multi-view super-resolution methods existing for the static case.

Our proposed algorithm first estimates camera viewpoint using rigid structure-from-motion, then reconstructs object shapes by optimizing over visual hull proposals guided by loose within-class shape similarity assumptions. The visual hull sampling process attempts to intersect an object's projection cone with the cones of minimal subsets of other similar objects among those pictured from certain vantage points. We show that our method is able to produce convincing per-object 3D reconstructions on one of the most challenging existing object-category detection datasets, PASCAL VOC. Our results may re-stimulate once popular geometry-oriented model-based recognition approaches.

    * Abstract: Metric learning has proved very successful. However, human annotations are necessary. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method, dubbed Metric Imitation (MI), where metrics over one cheap feature (target features, TFs) are learned by imitating the standard metrics over another sophisticated, off-the-shelf feature (source features, SFs) by transferring the view-independent property manifold structures. In particular, MI consists of: 1) quantifying the properties of source metrics as manifold geometry, 2) transferring the manifold from source domain to target domain, and 3) learning a mapping of TFs so that the manifold is approximated as well as possible in the mapped feature domain. MI is useful in at least two scenarios where: 1) TFs are more efficient computationally and in terms of memory than SFs; and 2) SFs contain privileged information, but they are not available during testing. For the former, MI is evaluated on image clustering, category-based image retrieval, and instance-based object retrieval, with three SFs and three TFs. For the latter, MI is tested on the task of example-based image super-resolution, where high-resolution patches are taken as SFs and low-resolution patches as TFs. Experiments show that MI is able to provide good metrics while avoiding expensive data labeling efforts and that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for image super-resolution. In addition, manifold transfer is an interesting direction of transfer learning.

    * Abstract: Our aim is to show how state-of-the-art computer vision techniques can be used to advance prehensile analysis (i.e., understanding the functionality of human hands). Prehensile analysis is a broad field of multi-disciplinary interest, where researchers painstakingly manually analyze hours of hand-object interaction videos to understand the mechanics of hand manipulation. In this work, we present promising empirical results indicating that wearable cameras and unsupervised clustering techniques can be used to automatically discover common modes of human hand use. In particular, we use a first-person point-of-view camera to record common manipulation tasks and leverage its strengths for reliably observing human hand use. To learn a diverse set of hand-object interactions, we propose a fast online clustering algorithm based on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP). Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical extension to the DPP clustering algorithm and show that it can be used to discover appearance-based grasp taxonomies. Using a purely data-driven approach, our proposed algorithm is able to obtain hand grasp taxonomies that roughly correspond to the classic Cutkosky grasp taxonomy. We validate our approach on over 10 hours of first-person point-of-view videos in both choreographed and real-life scenarios.

    * Abstract: We present an approach for highly accurate bottom-up object segmentation. Given an image, the approach rapidly generates a set of regions that delineate candidate objects in the image. The key idea is to train an ensemble of figure-ground segmentation models. The ensemble is trained jointly, enabling individual models to specialize and complement each other. We reduce ensemble training to a sequence of uncapacitated facility location problems and show that highly accurate segmentation ensembles can be trained by combinatorial optimization. The training procedure jointly optimizes the size of the ensemble, its composition, and the parameters of incorporated models, all for the same objective. The ensembles operate on elementary image features, enabling rapid image analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior object proposal algorithms by a significant margin, while having the lowest running time. The trained ensembles generalize across datasets, indicating that the presented approach is capable of learning a generally applicable model of bottom-up segmentation.

    * Abstract: Spatial verification is a key step in boosting the performance of object-based image retrieval. It serves to eliminate unreliable correspondences between salient points in a given pair of images and is typically performed by analyzing the consistency of spatial transformations between the image regions involved in individual correspondences. In this paper, we consider the pairwise geometric relations between correspondences and propose a strategy to incorporate these relations at significantly reduced computational cost, which makes it suitable for large-scale object retrieval. In addition, we combine the information on geometric relations from both the individual correspondences and pairs of correspondences to further improve the verification accuracy. Experimental results on three reference datasets show that the proposed approach results in a substantial performance improvement compared to the existing methods, without making concessions regarding computational efficiency.

    * Abstract: We present in this paper a superpixel segmentation algorithm called Linear Spectral Clustering (LSC), which produces compact and uniform superpixels with low computational costs. Basically, a normalized cuts formulation of the superpixel segmentation is adopted based on a similarity metric that measures the color similarity and space proximity between image pixels. However, instead of using the traditional eigen-based algorithm, we approximate the similarity metric using a kernel function leading to an explicitly mapping of pixel values and coordinates into a high dimensional feature space. We revisit the conclusion that by appropriately weighting each point in this feature space, the objective functions of weighted K-means and normalized cuts share the same optimum point. As such, it is possible to optimize the cost function of normalized cuts by iteratively applying simple K-means clustering in the proposed feature space. LSC is of linear computational complexity and high memory efficiency and is able to preserve global properties of images. Experimental results show that LSC performs equally well or better than state of the art superpixel segmentation algorithms in terms of several commonly used evaluation metrics in image segmentation.

    * Abstract: This paper originally proposes the clique-graph and further presents a clique-graph matching method by preserving global and local structures. Especially, we formulate the objective function of clique-graph matching with respective to two latent variables, the clique information in the original graph and the pairwise clique correspondence constrained by the one-to-one matching. Since the objective function is not jointly convex to both latent variables, we decompose it into two consecutive steps for optimization: 1) clique-to-clique similarity measure by preserving local unary and pairwise correspondences; 2) graph-to-graph similarity measure by preserving global clique-to-clique correspondence. Extensive experiments on the synthetic data and real images show that the proposed method can outperform representative methods especially when both noise and outliers exist.

    * Abstract: Structure-from-Motion for unordered image collections has significantly advanced in scale over the last decade. This impressive progress can be in part attributed to the introduction of efficient retrieval methods for those systems. While this boosts scalability, it also limits the amount of detail that the large-scale reconstruction systems are able to produce. In this paper, we propose a joint reconstruction and retrieval system that maintains the scalability of large-scale Structure-from-Motion systems while also recovering the often lost ability of reconstructing fine details of the scene. We demonstrate our proposed method on a large-scale dataset of 7.4 million images downloaded from the Internet.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of unsupervised segmentation in the form of superpixels. Our main emphasis is on speed and accuracy. We build on [31] to define the problem as a boundary and topology preserving Markov random field. We propose a coarse to fine optimization technique that speeds up inference in terms of the number of updates by an order of magnitude. Our approach is shown to outperform [31] while employing a single iteration. We evaluate and compare our approach to state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms on the BSD and KITTI benchmarks. Our approach significantly outperforms the baselines in the segmentation metrics and achieves the lowest error on the stereo task.

    * Abstract: We envision a future time when wearable cameras (e.g., small cameras in glasses or pinned on a shirt collar) are worn by the masses and record first-person point-of-view (POV) videos of everyday life. While these cameras can enable new assistive technologies and novel research challenges, they also raise serious privacy concerns. For example, first-person videos passively recorded by wearable cameras will necessarily include anyone who comes into the view of a camera -- with or without consent. Motivated by these benefits and risks, we develop a self-search technique tailored to first-person POV videos. The key observation of our work is that the egocentric head motions of a target person (i.e., the self) are observed both in the POV video of the target and observer. The motion correlation between the target person's video and the observer's video can then be used to uniquely identify instances of the self. We incorporate this feature into our proposed approach that computes the motion correlation over supervoxel hierarchies to localize target instances in observer videos. Our proposed approach significantly improves self-search performance over several well-known face detectors and recognizers. Furthermore, we show how our approach can enable several practical applications such as privacy filtering, automated video collection and social group discovery.

    * Abstract: People can immediately and precisely identify 1, 2, 3 or 4 items by a simple glance. The phenomenon, known as Subitizing, inspires us to pursue the task of Salient Object Subitizing (SOS), i.e. predicting the existence and the number of salient objects in a scene using holistic cues. To study this problem, we propose a new image dataset annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk. We show that for a substantial proportion of our dataset, there is a high labeling consistency among different subjects, even when a very limited viewing time (0.5s) is given. On our dataset, the baseline method using the global Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature achieves 94% recall rate in detecting the existence of salient objects, and 42-82% recall rate (chance is 20%) in predicting the number of salient objects (1, 2, 3, and 4+), without resorting to any object localization process. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed subitizing technique in two computer vision applications: salient object detection and object proposal.

    * Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions and manipulating motions lies in the heart of fine-grained action recognition. Previous methods heavily rely on explicit detection of the object being interacted, which requires intensive human labour on object annotation. To bypass this constraint and achieve better classification performance, in this work, we propose a novel fine-grained action recognition pipeline by interaction part proposal and discriminative mid-level part mining. Firstly, we generate a large number of candidate object regions using off-the-shelf object proposal tool, e.g., BING. Secondly, these object regions are matched and tracked across frames to form a large spatio-temporal graph based on the appearance matching and the dense motion trajectories through them. We then propose an efficient approximate graph segmentation algorithm to partition and filter the graph into consistent local dense sub-graphs. These sub-graphs, which are spatio-temporal sub-volumes, represent our candidate interaction parts. Finally, we mine discriminative mid-level part detectors from the features computed over the candidate interaction parts. Bag-of-detection scores based on a novel Max-N pooling scheme are computed as the action representation for a video sample. We conduct extensive experiments on human-object interaction datasets including MPII Cooking and MSR Daily Activity 3D. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art action recognition accuracies on the benchmarks, without using any object annotation.

    * Abstract: We tackle the problem of single image depth estimation, which, without additional knowledge, suffers from many ambiguities. Unlike previous approaches that only reason locally, we propose to exploit the global structure of the scene to estimate its depth. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical representation of the scene, which models local depth jointly with mid-level and global scene structures. We formulate single image depth estimation as inference in a graphical model whose edges let us encode the interactions within and across the different layers of our hierarchy. Our method therefore still produces detailed depth estimates, but also leverages higher-level information about the scene. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over local depth estimation methods on standard indoor datasets.

The motion model is adaptive and directed according to a simple yet powerful occlusion handling paradigm, which is intrinsically fused in the motion model. Also, since 3D trackers are sensitive to synchronization and registration noise in the RGB and depth streams, we propose automated methods to solve these two issues. Extensive experiments are conducted on a popular RGBD tracking benchmark, which demonstrate that our tracker can achieve superior results, outperforming many other recent and state-of-the-art RGBD trackers.

    * Abstract: We propose a motion-based method to discover the physical parts of an articulated object class (e.g. head/torso/leg of a horse) from multiple videos. The key is to find object regions that exhibit consistent motion relative to the rest of the object, across multiple videos. We can then learn a location model for the parts and segment them accurately in the individual videos using an energy function that also enforces temporal and spatial consistency in part motion. Unlike our approach, traditional methods for motion segmentation or non-rigid structure from motion operate on one video at a time. Hence they cannot discover a part unless it displays independent motion in that particular video. We evaluate our method on a new dataset of 32 videos of tigers and horses, where we significantly outperform a recent motion segmentation method on the task of part discovery (obtaining roughly twice the accuracy).

    * Authors: Inbar Huberman, Raanan Fattal
    * Abstract: In this paper we describe a new method for detecting and counting a repeating object in an image. While the method relies on a fairly sophisticated deformable part model, unlike existing techniques it estimates the model parameters in an unsupervised fashion thus alleviating the need for a user-annotated training data and avoiding the associated specificity. This automatic fitting process is carried out by exploiting the recurrence of small image patches associated with the repeating object and analyzing their spatial correlation. The analysis allows us to reject outlier patches, recover the visual and shape parameters of the part model, and detect the object instances efficiently. In order to achieve a practical system which is able to cope with diverse images, we describe a simple and intuitive active-learning procedure that updates the object classification by querying the user on very few carefully chosen marginal classifications. Evaluation of the new method against the state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates its ability to achieve higher accuracy through a better user experience.

    * Abstract: We propose a semi-automatic method to obtain foreground object masks for a large set of related images. We develop a stagewise active approach to propagation: in each stage, we actively determine the images that appear most valuable for human annotation, then revise the foreground estimates in all unlabeled images accordingly. In order to identify images that, once annotated, will propagate well to other examples, we introduce an active selection procedure that operates on the joint segmentation graph over all images. It prioritizes human intervention for those images that are uncertain and influential in the graph, while also mutually diverse. We apply our method to obtain foreground masks for over 1 million images. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy on the ImageNet and MIT Object Discovery datasets, and it focuses human attention more effectively than existing propagation strategies.

    * Abstract: An unsupervised video object segmentation algorithm, which discovers a primary object in a video sequence automatically, is proposed in this work. We introduce three energies in terms of foreground and background probability distributions: Markov, spatiotemporal, and antagonistic energies. Then, we minimize a hybrid of the three energies to separate a primary object from its background. However, the hybrid energy is nonconvex. Therefore, we develop the alternate convex optimization (ACO) scheme, which decomposes the nonconvex optimization into two quadratic programs. Moreover, we propose the forward-backward strategy, which performs the segmentation sequentially from the first to the last frames and then vice versa, to exploit temporal correlations. Experimental results on extensive datasets demonstrate that the proposed ACO algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques significantly.

    * Abstract: A primary object discovery (POD) algorithm for a video sequence is proposed in this work, which is capable of discovering a primary object, as well as identifying noisy frames that do not contain the object. First, we generate object proposals for each frame. Then, we bisect each proposal into foreground and background regions, and extract features from each region. By superposing the foreground and background features, we build the object recurrence model, the background model, and the primary object model. We develop an iterative scheme to refine each model evolutionary using the information in the other models. Finally, using the evolved primary object model, we select candidate proposals and locate the bounding box of a primary object by merging the proposals selectively. Experimental results on a challenging dataset demonstrate that the proposed POD algorithm extract primary objects accurately and robustly.

The primary advantages of the proposed method are: (1) use of recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which allow for parametrically efficient and effective image feature extraction; (2) an implicitly learned character-level language model, embodied in a recurrent neural network which avoids the need to use N-grams; and (3) the use of a soft-attention mechanism, allowing the model to selectively exploit image features in a coordinated way, and allowing for end-to-end training within a standard backpropagation framework. We validate our method with state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets: Street View Text, IIIT5k, ICDAR and Synth90k.

    * Abstract: Existing optical flow methods make generic, spatially homogeneous, assumptions about the spatial structure of the flow. In reality, optical flow varies across an image depending on object class. Simply put, different objects move differently. Here we exploit recent advances in static semantic scene segmentation to segment the image into objects of different types. We define different models of image motion in these regions depending on the type of object. For example, the road motion with homographies, vegetation with spatially smooth flow, and independently moving objects like cars and planes with affine+deviations. We then pose the flow estimation problem using a novel formulation of localized layers, which addresses limitations of traditional layered models for dealing with complex scene motion. Our semantic flow method achieves the lowest error of any published method in the KITTI-2015 flow benchmark and produces qualitatively better flow and segmentation than recent top methods on a wide range of natural videos.

    * Abstract: Recognizing text in natural images is a challenging task with many unsolved problems. Different from those in documents, words in natural images often possess irregular shapes, which are caused by perspective distortion, curved character placement, etc. We propose RARE (Robust text recognizer with Automatic REctification), a recognition model that is robust to irregular text. RARE is a specially-designed deep neural network, which consists of a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and a Sequence Recognition Network (SRN). In testing, an image is firstly rectified via a predicted Thin-Plate-Spline (TPS) transformation, into a more "readable" image for the following SRN, which recognizes text through a sequence recognition approach. We show that the model is able to recognize several types of irregular text, including perspective text and curved text. RARE is end-to-end trainable, requiring only images and associated text labels, making it convenient to train and deploy the model in practical systems. State-of-the-art or highly-competitive performance achieved on several benchmarks well demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

    * Abstract: We present a multi-stream bi-directional recurrent neural network for fine-grained action detection. Recently, two-stream convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on stacked optical flow and image frames have been successful for action recognition in videos. Our system uses a tracking algorithm to locate a bounding box around the person, which provides a frame of reference for appearance and motion and also suppresses background noise that is not within the bounding box. We train two additional streams on motion and appearance cropped to the tracked bounding box, along with full-frame streams. Our motion streams use pixel trajectories of a frame as raw features, in which the displacement values corresponding to a moving scene point are at the same spatial position across several frames. To model long-term temporal dynamics within and between actions, the multi-stream CNN is followed by a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer. We show that our bi-directional LSTM network utilizes about 8 seconds of the video sequence to predict an action label. We test on two action detection datasets: the MPII Cooking 2 Dataset, and a new MERL Shopping Dataset that we introduce and make available to the community with this paper. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art action detection methods on both datasets.

    * Abstract: Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set and demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art via to carefully factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.

    * Authors: Robert Walecki, Ognjen Rudovic, Vladimir Pavlovic, Maja Pantic
    * Abstract: Joint modeling of the intensity of facial action units (AUs) from face images is challenging due to the large number of AUs (30+) and their intensity levels (6). This is in part due to the lack of suitable models that can efficiently handle such a large number of outputs/classes simultaneously, but also due to the lack of target data. For this reason, majority of the methods proposed resort to independent classifiers for the AU intensity. This is suboptimal for at least two reasons: the facial appearance of some AUs changes depending on the intensity of other AUs, and some AUs co-occur more often than others. Encoding this is expected to improve the estimation of target AU intensities, especially in the case of noisy image features, head-pose variations and imbalanced training data. To this end, we introduce a novel modeling framework, Copula Ordinal Regression (COR), that leverages the power of copula functions and CRFs, to detangle the probabilistic modeling of AU dependencies from the marginal modeling of the AU intensity. Consequently, the COR model achieves the joint learning and inference of intensities of multiple AUs, while being computationally tractable. We show on two challenging datasets of naturalistic facial expressions that the proposed approach consistently outperforms (i) independent modeling of AU intensities, and (ii) the state-of-the-art approach for the target task.

    * Abstract: We present an unsupervised approach that generates a diverse, ranked set of bounding box and segmentation video object proposals---spatio-temporal tubes that localize the foreground objects---in an unannotated video. In contrast to previous unsupervised methods that either track regions initialized in an arbitrary frame or train a fixed model over a cluster of regions, we instead discover a set of easy-to-group instances of an object and then iteratively update its appearance model to gradually detect harder instances in temporally-adjacent frames. Our method first generates a set of spatio-temporal bounding box proposals, and then refines them to obtain pixel-wise segmentation proposals. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art segmentation results on the SegTrack v2 dataset, and bounding box tracking results that perform competitively to state-of-the-art supervised tracking methods.

    * Abstract: State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods are based on expressing each data point as a linear combination of other data points while regularizing the matrix of coefficients with l_1, l_2 or nuclear norms. l_1 regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e., there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad theoretical conditions, but the clusters may not be connected. l_2 and nuclear norm regularization often improve connectivity, but give a subspace-preserving affinity only for independent subspaces. Mixed l_1, l_2 and nuclear norm regularizations offer a balance between the subspace-preserving and connectedness properties, but this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. This paper studies the geometry of the elastic net regularizer (a mixture of the l_1 and l_2 norms) and uses it to derive a provably correct and scalable active set method for finding the optimal coefficients. Our geometric analysis also provides a theoretical justification and a geometric interpretation for the balance between the connectedness (due to l_2 regularization) and subspace-preserving (due to l_1 regularization) properties for elastic net subspace clustering. Our experiments show that the proposed active set method not only achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance, but also efficiently handles large-scale datasets.

    * Abstract: Subspace clustering methods based on ell_1, l_2 or nuclear norm regularization have become very popular due to their simplicity, theoretical guarantees and empirical success. However, the choice of the regularizer can greatly impact both theory and practice. For instance, ell_1 regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e., there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad conditions e.g., arbitrary subspaces and corrupted data). However, it requires solving a large scale convex optimization problem. On the other hand, l_2 and nuclear norm regularization provide efficient closed form solutions, but require very strong assumptions to guarantee a subspace-preserving affinity, e.g., independent subspaces and uncorrupted data. In this paper we study a subspace clustering method based on orthogonal matching pursuit. We show that the method is both computationally efficient and guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity under broad conditions. Experiments on synthetic data verify our theoretical analysis, and applications in handwritten digit and face clustering show that our approach achieves the best trade off between accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, our approach is the first one to handle 100,000 data points.

    * Abstract: Automatic tracking of large-scale crowded targets are of particular importance in many applications, such as crowded people/vehicle tracking in video surveillance, fiber tracking in materials science, and cell tracking in biomedical imaging. This problem becomes very challenging when the targets show similar appearance and the inter-slice/inter-frame continuity is low due to sparse sampling, camera motion and target occlusion. The main challenge comes from the step of association which aims at matching the predictions and the observations of the multiple targets. In this paper we propose a new groupwise method to explore the target group information and employ the within-group correlations for association and tracking. In particular, the within-group association is modeled by a nonrigid 2D Thin-Plate transform and a sequence of group shrinking, group growing and group merging operations are then developed to refine the composition of each group. We apply the propose method to track large-scale fibers from the microscopy material images and compare its performance against several other multi-target tracking methods. We also apply the proposed method to track crowded people from videos with poor inter-frame continuity.

    * Abstract: It is a challenging problem to accurately estimate gazes from low-resolution eye images that do not provide fine and detailed features for eyes. Existing methods attempt to establish the mapping between the visual appearance space to the gaze space. Different from the direct regression approach, the reconstruction-based approach represents appearance and gaze via local linear reconstruction in their own spaces. A common treatment is to use the same local reconstruction in the two spaces, i.e., the reconstruction weights in the appearance space are transferred to the gaze space for gaze reconstruction. However, this questionable treatment is taken for granted but has never been justified, leading to significant errors in gaze estimation. This paper is focused on the study of this fundamental issue. It shows that the distance metric in the appearance space needs to be adjusted, before the same reconstruction can be used. A novel method is proposed to learn the metric, such that the affinity structure of the appearance space under this new metric is as close as possible to the affinity structure of the gaze space under the normal Euclidean metric. Furthermore, the local affinity structure invariance is utilized to further regularize the solution to the reconstruction weights, so as to obtain a more robust and accurate solution. Effectiveness of the proposed method is validated and demonstrated through extensive experiments on different subjects.

    * Abstract: For spectral embedding/clustering, it is still an open problem on how to construct an relation graph to reflect the intrinsic structures in data. In this paper, we proposed an approach, named Relation Discovery based Slow Feature Analysis (ReD-SFA), for feature learning and graph construction simultaneously. Given an initial graph with only a few nearest but most reliable pairwise relations, new reliable relations are discovered by an assumption of reliability preservation, i.e., the reliable relations will preserve their reliabilities in the learnt projection subspace. We formulate the idea as a cross entropy (CE) minimization problem to reduce the discrepancy between two Bernoulli distributions parameterized by the updated distances and the existing relation graph respectively. Furthermore, to overcome the imbalanced distribution of samples, a Boosting-like strategy is proposed to balance the discovered relations over all clusters. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments are performed with various trajectory clustering tasks, including motion segmentation, time series clustering and crowd detection. The results demonstrate that ReD-SFA can discover reliable intra-cluster relations with high precision, and competitive clustering performance can be achieved in comparison with state-of-the-art.

While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that exposes the implicit attention of CNNs on image. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014 without training on any bounding box annotation. We demonstrate that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions on a variety of tasks despite not being trained for them.

    * Abstract: Topological data analysis is a popular way to study high dimensional feature spaces without any contextual clues or assumptions. This paper concerns itself with one popular topological feature -- the number of d-dimensional holes in the dataset, also known as the Betti-d number. The persistence of these Betti numbers using persistence diagrams (PD). A common way to compare PDs is the n-Wasserstein metric. However, a big drawback of this approach is the need to solve correspondence before computing the distance. Instead, we propose to use an entirely new framework built on Riemannian geometry, that models PDs on a Hilbert Sphere. The resulting space is much more intuitive and the distance metric is correspondence-free thereby eliminating the bottleneck. It also enables the use of existing machinery in differential geometry towards statistical analysis of PDs such as computing the mean, geodesics etc. We report competitive results compared with the Wasserstein metric.

    * Abstract: Segmentation of cervical cells in microscopic images is an important task for computer-aided diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, their segmentation is challenging due to inhomogeneous cell cytoplasm and the overlap between the cells. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method for multiple overlapping cervical cells in microscopic images using superpixel partitioning and cell-wise contour refinement. First, the cell masses are detected by superpixel generation and triangle thresholding. Then, nuclei of cells are extracted by local thresholding and outlier removal. Finally, cell cytoplasm is initially segmented by superpixel partitioning and refined by cell-wise contour refinement with graph cuts. In experiments, our method showed competitive performances in two public challenge data sets compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: Vehicle tracking from a moving aerial platform poses a number of unique challenges including the small number of pixels representing a vehicle, large camera motion, and parallax error. This paper considers a multi-modal sensor to design a real-time persistent aerial tracking system. Wide field of view (FOV) panchromatic imagery is used to remove global camera motion whereas narrow FOV hyperspectral image is used to detect the target of interest (TOI). Hyperspectral features provide distinctive information to reject objects with different reflectance characteristics from the TOI. This way the density of detected vehicles is reduced, which increases tracking consistency. Finally, we use a spatial data based classifier to remove spurious detections. With such framework, parallax effect in non-planar scenes is avoided. The proposed tracking system is evaluated in a dense, synthetic scene and outperforms other state-of-the-art traditional and aerial object trackers.

    * Abstract: Thermal infrared-visible video registration for non-planar scenes is a new area in visual surveillance. It allows the combination of information from two spectra for better human detection and segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel online framework for visible and thermal infrared registration in non-planar scenes that includes foreground segmentation, feature matching, rectification and disparity calculation. Our proposed approach is based on sparse correspondences of contour points. The key ideas of the proposed framework are the removal of spurious regions at the beginning of videos and a registration methodology for non-planar scenes. Besides, a new non-planar dataset with an associated evaluation protocol is also proposed as a standard assessment. We evaluate our method on both public planar and non-planar datasets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can not only successfully handle non-planar scenes but also gets state-of-the-art results on planar ones.

    * Abstract: Over the past few years, softmax and SGD have become a commonly used component and the default training strategy in CNN frameworks, respectively. However, when optimizing CNNs with SGD, the saturation behavior behind softmax always gives us an illusion of training well and then is omitted. In this paper, we first emphasize that the early saturation behavior of softmax will impede the exploration of SGD, which sometimes is a reason for model converging at a bad local-minima, then propose Noisy Softmax to mitigating this early saturation issue by injecting annealed noise in softmax during each iteration. This operation based on noise injection aims at postponing the early saturation and further bringing continuous gradients propagation so as to significantly encourage SGD solver to be more exploratory and help to find a better local-minima. This paper empirically verifies the superiority of the early softmax desaturation, and our method indeed improves the generalization ability of CNN model by regularization. We experimentally find that this early desaturation helps optimization in many tasks, yielding state-of-the-art or competitive results on several popular benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Most popular deep models for action recognition split video sequences into short sub-sequences consisting of a few frames; frame-based features are then pooled for recognizing the activity. Usually, this pooling step discards the temporal order of the frames, which could otherwise be used for better recognition. Towards this end, we propose a novel pooling method, generalized rank pooling (GRP), that takes as input, features from the intermediate layers of a CNN that is trained on tiny sub-sequences, and produces as output the parameters of a subspace which (i) provides a low-rank approximation to the features and (ii) preserves their temporal order. We propose to use these parameters as a compact representation for the video sequence, which is then used in a classification setup. We formulate an objective for computing this subspace as a Riemannian optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, and propose an efficient conjugate gradient scheme for solving it. Experiments on several activity recognition datasets show that our scheme leads to state-of-the-art performance.

    * Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods can be broadly categorized as incremental or global according to their ways to estimate initial camera poses. While incremental system has advanced in robustness and accuracy, the efficiency remains its key challenge. To solve this problem, global reconstruction system simultaneously estimates all camera poses from the epipolar geometry graph, but it is usually sensitive to outliers. In this work, we propose a new hybrid SfM method to tackle the issues of efficiency, accuracy and robustness in a unified framework. More specifically, we propose an adaptive community-based rotation averaging method first to estimate camera rotations in a global manner. Then, based on these estimated camera rotations, camera centers are computed in an incremental way. Extensive experiments show that our hybrid method performs similarly or better than many of the state-of-the-art global SfM approaches, in terms of computational efficiency, while achieves similar reconstruction accuracy and robustness with two other state-of-the-art incremental SfM approaches.

    * Abstract: Efficient estimation of depth from pairs of stereo images is one of the core problems in computer vision. We efficiently solve the specialized problem of stereo matching under active illumination using a new learning-based algorithm. This type of 'active' stereo i.e. stereo matching where scene texture is augmented by an active light projector is proving compelling for designing depth cameras, largely due to improved robustness when compared to time of flight or traditional structured light techniques. Our algorithm uses an unsupervised greedy optimization scheme that learns features that are discriminative for estimating correspondences in infrared images. The proposed method optimizes a series of sparse hyperplanes that are used at test time to remap all the image patches into a compact binary representation in O(1). The proposed algorithm is cast in a PatchMatch Stereo-like framework, producing depth maps at 500Hz. In contrast to standard structured light methods, our approach generalizes to different scenes, does not require tedious per camera calibration procedures and is not adversely affected by interference from overlapping sensors. Extensive evaluations show we surpass the quality and overcome the limitations of current depth sensing technologies.

    * Abstract: In this paper we propose to learn a mapping from image pixels into a dense template grid through a fully convolutional network. We formulate this task as a regression problem and train our network by leveraging upon manually annotated facial landmarks 'in-the-wild'. We use such landmarks to establish a dense correspondence field between a three-dimensional object template and the input image, which then serves as the ground-truth for training our regression system. We show that we can combine ideas from semantic segmentation with regression networks, yielding a highly-accurate `quantized regression' architecture. Our system, called DenseReg, allows us to estimate dense image-to-template correspondences in a fully convolutional manner. As such our network can provide useful correspondence information as a stand-alone system, while when used as an initialization for Statistical Deformable Models we obtain landmark localization results that largely outperform the current state-of-the-art on the challenging 300W benchmark. We thoroughly evaluate our method on a host of facial analysis tasks, and demonstrate its use for other correspondence estimation tasks, such as the human body and the human ear. DenseReg code is made available at http://alpguler.com/DenseReg.html along with supplementary materials.

    * Abstract: The inherent noise in the observed (e.g., scanned) binary document image degrades the image quality and harms the compression ratio through breaking the pattern repentance and adding entropy to the document images. In this paper, we design a cost function in Bayesian framework with dictionary learning. Minimizing our cost function produces a restored image which has better quality than that of the observed noisy image, and a dictionary for representing and encoding the image. After the restoration, we use this dictionary (from the same cost function) to encode the restored image following the symbol-dictionary framework by JBIG2 standard with the lossless mode. Experimental results with a variety of document images demonstrate that our method improves the image quality compared with the observed image, and simultaneously improves the compression ratio. For the test images with synthetic noise, our method reduces the number of flipped pixels by 48.2% and improves the compression ratio by 36.36% as compared with the best encoding methods. For the test images with real noise, our method visually improves the image quality, and outperforms the cutting-edge method by 28.27% in terms of the compression ratio.

    * Abstract: We present a CNN-based technique to estimate high-dynamic range outdoor illumination from a single low dynamic range image. To train the CNN, we leverage a large dataset of outdoor panoramas. We fit a low-dimensional physically-based outdoor illumination model to the skies in these panoramas giving us a compact set of parameters (including sun position, atmospheric conditions, and camera parameters). We extract limited field-of-view images from the panoramas, and train a CNN with this large set of input image--output lighting parameter pairs. Given a test image, this network can be used to infer illumination parameters that can, in turn, be used to reconstruct an outdoor illumination environment map. We demonstrate that our approach allows the recovery of plausible illumination conditions and enables photorealistic virtual object insertion from a single image. An extensive evaluation on both the panorama dataset and captured HDR environment maps shows that our technique significantly outperforms previous solutions to this problem.

    * Abstract: This paper introduces a deep architecture for segmenting 3D objects into their labeled semantic parts. Our architecture combines image-based Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and surface-based Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to yield coherent segmentations of 3D shapes. The image-based FCNs are used for efficient view-based reasoning about 3D object parts. Through a special projection layer, FCN outputs are effectively aggregated across multiple views and scales, then are projected onto the 3D object surfaces. Finally, a surface-based CRF combines the projected outputs with geometric consistency cues to yield coherent segmentations. The whole architecture (multi-view FCNs and CRF) is trained end-to-end. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in the currently largest segmentation benchmark (ShapeNet). Finally, we demonstrate promising segmentation results on noisy 3D shapes acquired from consumer-grade depth cameras.

    * Abstract: A novel contour-constrained superpixel (CCS) algorithm is proposed in this work. We initialize superpixels and regions in a regular grid and then refine the superpixel label of each region hierarchically from block to pixel levels. To make superpixel boundaries compatible with object contours, we propose the notion of contour pattern matching and formulate an objective function including the contour constraint. Furthermore, we extend the CCS algorithm to generate temporal superpixels for video processing. We initialize superpixel labels in each frame by transferring those in the previous frame and refine the labels to make superpixels temporally consistent as well as compatible with object contours. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides better performance than the state-of-the-art superpixel methods.

    * Abstract: We state a combinatorial optimization problem whose feasible solutions define both a decomposition and a node labeling of a given graph. This problem offers a common mathematical abstraction of seemingly unrelated computer vision tasks, including instance-separating semantic segmentation, articulated human body pose estimation and multiple object tracking. Conceptually, it generalizes the unconstrained integer quadratic program and the minimum cost lifted multicut problem, both of which are NP-hard. In order to find feasible solutions efficiently, we define two local search algorithms that converge monotonously to a local optimum, offering a feasible solution at any time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in tackling computer vision tasks, we apply them to instances of the problem that we construct from published data, using published algorithms. We report state-of-the-art application-specific accuracy in the three above-mentioned applications.

    * Abstract: This paper strives to track a target object in a video. Rather than specifying the target in the first frame of a video by a bounding box, we propose to track the object based on a natural language specification of the target, which provides a more natural human-machine interaction as well as a means to improve tracking results. We define three variants of tracking by language specification: one relying on lingual target specification only, one relying on visual target specification based on language, and one leveraging their joint capacity. To show the potential of tracking by natural language specification we extend two popular tracking datasets with lingual descriptions and report experiments. Finally, we also sketch new tracking scenarios in surveillance and other live video streams that become feasible with a lingual specification of the target.

    * Authors: Jiasen Lu, Caiming Xiong, Devi Parikh, Richard Socher
    * Abstract: Attention-based neural encoder-decoder frameworks have been widely adopted for image captioning. Most methods force visual attention to be active for every generated word. However, the decoder likely requires little to no visual information from the image to predict non-visual words such as "the" and "of". Other words that may seem visual can often be predicted reliably just from the language model e.g., "sign" after "behind a red stop" or "phone" following "talking on a cell". In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive attention model with a visual sentinel. At each time step, our model decides whether to attend to the image (and if so, to which regions) or to the visual sentinel. The model decides whether to attend to the image and where, in order to extract meaningful information for sequential word generation. We test our method on the COCO image captioning 2015 challenge dataset and Flickr30K. Our approach sets the new state-of-the-art by a significant margin.

    * Abstract: Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.

    * Authors: Mengye Ren, Richard S. Zemel
    * Abstract: While convolutional neural networks have gained impressive success recently in solving structured prediction problems such as semantic segmentation, it remains a challenge to differentiate individual object instances in the scene. Instance segmentation is very important in a variety of applications, such as autonomous driving, image captioning, and visual question answering. Techniques that combine large graphical models with low-level vision have been proposed to address this problem; however, we propose an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism to model a human-like counting process, and produce detailed instance segmentations. The network is jointly trained to sequentially produce regions of interest as well as a dominant object segmentation within each region. The proposed model achieves competitive results on the CVPPP, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets.

    * Abstract: Learning how to generate descriptions of images or videos received major interest both in the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities. While a few works have proposed to learn a grounding during the generation process in an unsupervised way (via an attention mechanism), it remains unclear how good the quality of the grounding is and whether it benefits the description quality. In this work we propose a movie description model which learns to generate description and jointly ground (localize) the mentioned characters as well as do visual co-reference resolution between pairs of consecutive sentences/clips. We also propose to use weak localization supervision through character mentions provided in movie descriptions to learn the character grounding. At training time, we first learn how to localize characters by relating their visual appearance to mentions in the descriptions via a semi-supervised approach. We then provide this (noisy) supervision into our description model which greatly improves its performance. Our proposed description model improves over prior work w.r.t. generated description quality and additionally provides grounding and local co-reference resolution. We evaluate it on the MPII Movie Description dataset using automatic and human evaluation measures and using our newly collected grounding and co-reference data for characters.

    * Abstract: Text instance as one category of self-described objects provides valuable information for understanding and describing cluttered scenes. In this paper, we explore the task of unambiguous text localization and retrieval, to accurately localize a specific targeted text instance in a cluttered image given a natural language description that refers to it. To address this issue, first a novel recurrent Dense Text Localization Network (DTLN) is proposed to sequentially decode the intermediate convolutional representations of a cluttered scene image into a set of distinct text instance detections. Our approach avoids repeated detections at multiple scales of the same text instance by recurrently memorizing previous detections, and effectively tackles crowded text instances in close proximity. Second, we propose a Context Reasoning Text Retrieval (CRTR) model, which jointly encodes text instances and their context information through a recurrent network, and ranks localized text bounding boxes by a scoring function of context compatibility. Quantitative evaluations on standard scene text localization benchmarks and a newly collected scene text retrieval dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our models for both scene text localization and retrieval.

In this work, we propose such a general algorithm. It depends on several parameters, which can be used to optimize its performance in each particular setting. We demonstrate efficiency of our method on the graph matching and the multicut problems, where it outperforms state-of-the-art solvers including those based on the subgradient optimization and off-the-shelf linear programming solvers.

Like other polyhedral relaxations, it can be tightened efficiently by cutting planes. We define an algorithm that alternates between message passing and efficient separation of cycle- and odd-wheel inequalities. This algorithm is more efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms based on linear programming, including algorithms written in the framework of leading commercial software, as we show in experiments with large instances of the problem from applications in computer vision, biomedical image analysis and data mining.

    * Abstract: We propose a new multi-frame method for efficiently computing scene flow (dense depth and optical flow) and camera ego-motion for a dynamic scene observed from a moving stereo camera rig. Our technique also segments out moving objects from the rigid scene. In our method, we first estimate the disparity map and the 6-DOF camera motion using stereo matching and visual odometry. We then identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This flow proposal is fused with the camera motion-based flow proposal using fusion moves to obtain the final optical flow and motion segmentation. This unified framework benefits all four tasks -- stereo, optical flow, visual odometry and motion segmentation leading to overall higher accuracy and efficiency. Our method is currently ranked third on the KITTI 2015 scene flow benchmark. Furthermore, our CPU implementation runs in 2-3 seconds per frame which is 1-3 orders of magnitude faster than the top six methods. We also report a thorough evaluation on challenging Sintel sequences with fast camera and object motion, where our method consistently outperforms OSF [Menze2015], which is currently ranked second on the KITTI benchmark.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm that utilizes a 2D floorplan to align panorama RGBD scans. While effective panorama RGBD alignment techniques exist, such a system requires extremely dense RGBD image sampling. Our approach can significantly reduce the number of necessary scans with the aid of a floorplan image. We formulate a novel Markov Random Field inference problem as a scan placement over the floorplan, as opposed to the conventional scan-to-scan alignment. The technical contributions lie in multi-modal image correspondence cues (between scans and schematic floorplan) as well as a novel coverage potential avoiding an inherent stacking bias. The proposed approach has been evaluated on five challenging large indoor spaces. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first effective system that utilizes a 2D floorplan image for building-scale 3D pointcloud alignment. The source code and the data are shared with the community to further enhance indoor mapping research.

    * Abstract: In recent years, a great number of datasets were published to train and evaluate computer vision (CV) algorithms. These valuable contributions helped to push CV solutions to a level where they can be used for safety-relevant applications, such as autonomous driving. However, major questions concerning quality and usefulness of test data for CV evaluation are still unanswered. Researchers and engineers try to cover all test cases by using as much test data as possible. In this paper, we propose a different solution for this challenge. We introduce a method for dataset analysis which builds upon an improved version of the CV-HAZOP checklist, a list of potential hazards within the CV domain. Picking stereo vision as an example, we provide an extensive survey of 28 datasets covering the last two decades. We create a tailored checklist and apply it to the datasets Middlebury, KITTI, Sintel, Freiburg, and HCI to present a thorough characterization and quantitative comparison. We confirm the usability of our checklist for identification of challenging stereo situations by applying nine state-of-the-art stereo matching algorithms on the analyzed datasets, showing that hazard frames correlate with difficult frames. We show that challenging datasets still allow a meaningful algorithm evaluation even for small subsets. Finally, we provide a list of missing test cases that are still not covered by current datasets as inspiration for researchers who want to participate in future dataset creation.

    * Abstract: Previous approaches for scene text detection have already achieved promising performances across various benchmarks. However, they usually fall short when dealing with challenging scenarios, even when equipped with deep neural network models, because the overall performance is determined by the interplay of multiple stages and components in the pipelines. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful pipeline that yields fast and accurate text detection in natural scenes. The pipeline directly predicts words or text lines of arbitrary orientations and quadrilateral shapes in full images, eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps (e.g., candidate aggregation and word partitioning), with a single neural network. The simplicity of our pipeline allows concentrating efforts on designing loss functions and neural network architecture. Experiments on standard datasets including ICDAR 2015, COCO-Text and MSRA-TD500 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. On the ICDAR 2015 dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves an F-score of 0.7820 at 13.2fps at 720p resolution.

    * Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) remains a challenging problem due to significant appearance changes caused by variations in view angle, background clutter, illumination condition and mutual occlusion. To address these issues, conventional methods usually focus on proposing robust feature representation or learning metric transformation based on pairwise similarity, using Fisher-type criterion. The recent development in deep learning based approaches address the two processes in a joint fashion and have achieved promising progress. One of the key issues for deep learning based person Re-ID is the selection of proper similarity comparison criteria, and the performance of learned features using existing criterion based on pairwise similarity is still limited, because only P2P distances are mostly considered. In this paper, we present a novel person Re-ID method based on P2S similarity comparison. The P2S metric can jointly minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance, while back-propagating the gradient to optimize parameters of the deep model. By utilizing our proposed P2S metric, the learned deep model can effectively distinguish different persons by learning discriminative and stable feature representations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on 3DPeS, CUHK01, PRID2011 and Market1501 datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

    * Abstract: Scene parsing, or recognizing and segmenting objects and stuff in an image, is one of the key problems in computer vision. Despite the community's efforts in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of scenes and object categories with dense and detailed annotations for scene parsing. In this paper, we introduce and analyze the ADE20K dataset, spanning diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts. A scene parsing benchmark is built upon the ADE20K with 150 object and stuff classes included. Several segmentation baseline models are evaluated on the benchmark. A novel network design called Cascade Segmentation Module is proposed to parse a scene into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade and improve over the baselines. We further show that the trained scene parsing networks can lead to applications such as image content removal and scene synthesis(Dataset and pretrained models are available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/).

    * Abstract: The latest deep learning approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art signal processing approaches in various image restoration tasks. However, if an image contains many patterns and structures, the performance of these CNNs is still inferior. To address this issue, here we propose a novel feature space deep residual learning algorithm that outperforms the existing residual learning. The main idea is originated from the observation that the performance of a learning algorithm can be improved if the input and/or label manifolds can be made topologically simpler by an analytic mapping to a feature space. Our extensive numerical studies using denoising experiments and NTIRE single-image super-resolution (SISR) competition demonstrate that the proposed feature space residual learning outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our algorithm was ranked high in the NTIRE competition with 5-10 times faster computational time compared to the top ranked teams.

    * Abstract: Video blogs (vlogs) are a popular media form for people to present themselves. In case a vlogger would be a job candidate, vlog content can be useful for automatically assessing the candidate's traits, as well as potential interviewability. Using a dataset from the CVPR ChaLearn competition, we build a model predicting Big Five personality trait scores and interviewability of vloggers, explicitly targeting explainability of the system output to humans without technical background. We use human-explainable features as input, and a linear model for the system's building blocks. Four multimodal feature representations are constructed to capture facial expression, movement, and linguistic usage. For each, PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and simple linear regression for the predictive model. Our system's accuracy lies in the middle of the quantitative competition chart, while we can trace back the reasoning behind each score and generate a qualitative analysis report per video.

    * Abstract: Hyperspectral cameras provide unique spectral signatures that can be used to solve surveillance tasks. This paper proposes a novel real-time hyperspectral likelihood maps-aided tracking method (HLT) inspired by an adaptive hyperspectral sensor. We focus on the target detection part of a tracking system and remove the necessity to build any offline classifiers and tune large amount of hyper-parameters, instead learning a generative target model in an online manner for hyperspectral channels ranging from visible to infrared wavelengths. The key idea is that our adaptive fusion method can combine likelihood maps from multiple bands of hyperspectral imagery into one single more distinctive representation increasing the margin between mean value of foreground and background pixels in the fused map.

    * Abstract: We present a novel on-board perception system for collision avoidance by micro air vehicles (MAV). An egocentric cylindrical representation is utilized to model the world using forward-looking stereo vision. This efficient representation enables a 360o field of regard, as the vehicle moves around and disparity maps are fused temporally on the cylindrical map. For this purpose, we developed a new Gaussian Mixture Models-based disparity image fusion algorithm, with an extension to handle independently moving objects (IMO). The extension improves scene models in case of moving objects, where standard temporal fusion approaches cannot detect movers and introduce errors in world models due to the common static scene assumption. The on-board implementation of the vision pipeline provides disparity maps on a 360o egocentric cylindrical surface at 10 Hz. The perception output is used in our system by real-time motion planning with collision avoidance on the MAV.

    * Abstract: We present a method for foreground segmentation of yeast cells in the presence of high-noise induced by intentional low illumination, where traditional approaches (e.g., threshold-based methods, specialized cell-segmentation methods) fail. To deal with these harsh conditions, we use a fully-convolutional semantic segmentation network based on the SegNet architecture. Our model is capable of segmenting patches extracted from yeast live-cell experiments with a mIOU score of 0.71 on unseen patches drawn from independent experiments. Further, we show that simultaneous multi-modal observations of bio-fluorescent markers can result in better segmentation performance than the DIC channel alone.

    * Abstract: Existing systems for video-based pose estimation and tracking struggle to perform well on realistic videos with multiple people and often fail to output body-pose trajectories consistent over time. To address this shortcoming this paper introduces PoseTrack which is a new large-scale benchmark for video-based human pose estimation and articulated tracking. Our new benchmark encompasses three tasks focusing on i) single-frame multi-person pose estimation, ii) multi-person pose estimation in videos, and iii) multi-person articulated tracking. To establish the benchmark, we collect, annotate and release a new dataset that features videos with multiple people labeled with person tracks and articulated pose. A public centralized evaluation server is provided to allow the research community to evaluate on a held-out test set. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive experimental study on recent approaches to articulated pose tracking and provide analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the state of the art. We envision that the proposed benchmark will stimulate productive research both by providing a large and representative training dataset as well as providing a platform to objectively evaluate and compare the proposed methods. The benchmark is freely accessible at https://posetrack.net/.

    * Abstract: Mapping road networks is currently both expensive and labor-intensive. High-resolution aerial imagery provides a promising avenue to automatically infer a road network. Prior work uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect which pixels belong to a road (segmentation), and then uses complex post-processing heuristics to infer graph connectivity. We show that these segmentation methods have high error rates because noisy CNN outputs are difficult to correct. We propose RoadTracer, a new method to automatically construct accurate road network maps from aerial images. RoadTracer uses an iterative search process guided by a CNN-based decision function to derive the road network graph directly from the output of the CNN. We compare our approach with a segmentation method on fifteen cities, and find that at a 5% error rate, RoadTracer correctly captures 45% more junctions across these cities.

    * Abstract: Synthesizing realistic images from human drawn sketches is a challenging problem in computer graphics and vision. Existing approaches either need exact edge maps, or rely on retrieval of existing photographs. In this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approach that synthesizes plausible images from 50 categories including motorcycles, horses and couches. We demonstrate a data augmentation technique for sketches which is fully automatic, and we show that the augmented data is helpful to our task. We introduce a new network building block suitable for both the generator and discriminator which improves the information flow by injecting the input image at multiple scales. Compared to state-of-the-art image translation methods, our approach generates more realistic images and achieves significantly higher Inception Scores.

    * Abstract: This paper considers the problem of inferring image labels from images when only a few annotated examples are available at training time. This setup is often referred to as low-shot learning, where a standard approach is to re-train the last few layers of a convolutional neural network learned on separate classes for which training examples are abundant. We consider a semi-supervised setting based on a large collection of images to support label propagation. This is possible by leveraging the recent advances on large-scale similarity graph construction. We show that despite its conceptual simplicity, scaling label propagation up to hundred millions of images leads to state of the art accuracy in the low-shot learning regime.

    * Abstract: Supervised object detection and semantic segmentation require object or even pixel level annotations. When there exist image level labels only, it is challenging for weakly supervised algorithms to achieve accurate predictions. The accuracy achieved by top weakly supervised algorithms is still significantly lower than their fully supervised counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised curriculum learning pipeline for multi-label object recognition, detection and semantic segmentation. In this pipeline, we first obtain intermediate object localization and pixel labeling results for the training images, and then use such results to train task-specific deep networks in a fully supervised manner. The entire process consists of four stages, including object localization in the training images, filtering and fusing object instances, pixel labeling for the training images, and task-specific network training. To obtain clean object instances in the training images, we propose a novel algorithm for filtering, fusing and classifying object instances collected from multiple solution mechanisms. In this algorithm, we incorporate both metric learning and density-based clustering to filter detected object instances. Experiments show that our weakly supervised pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-label image classification as well as weakly supervised object detection and very competitive results in weakly supervised semantic segmentation on MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012.

    * Abstract: We present a semantic part detection approach that effectively leverages object information. We use the object appearance and its class as indicators of what parts to expect. We also model the expected relative location of parts inside the objects based on their appearance. We achieve this with a new network module, called OffsetNet, that efficiently predicts a variable number of part locations within a given object. Our model incorporates all these cues to detect parts in the context of their objects. This leads to considerably higher performance for the challenging task of part detection compared to using part appearance alone (+5 mAP on the PASCAL-Part dataset). We also compare to other part detection methods on both PASCAL-Part and CUB200-2011 datasets.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of online road network extraction from sparse 3D point clouds. Our method is inspired by how an annotator builds a lane graph, by first identifying how many lanes there are and then drawing each one in turn. We develop a hierarchical recurrent network that attends to initial regions of a lane boundary and traces them out completely by outputting a structured polyline. We also propose a novel differentiable loss function that measures the deviation of the edges of the ground truth polylines and their predictions. This is more suitable than distances on vertices, as there exists many ways to draw equivalent polylines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a 90 km stretch of highway, and show that we can recover the right topology 92% of the time.

    * Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression is a powerful tool in non-parametric regression providing uncertainty estimates. However, it is limited to data in vector spaces. In fields such as shape analysis and diffusion tensor imaging, the data often lies on a manifold, making GP regression non- viable, as the resulting predictive distribution does not live in the correct geometric space. We tackle the problem by defining wrapped Gaussian processes (WGPs) on Rieman- nian manifolds, using the probabilistic setting to general- ize GP regression to the context of manifold-valued targets. The method is validated empirically on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data, directional data on the sphere and in the Kendall shape space, endorsing WGP regression as an efficient and flexible tool for manifold-valued regression.

    * Abstract: Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Conditonal GANs (CGANs) show that using a trained network as loss function (discriminator) enables to synthesize highly structured outputs (e.g. natural images). However, applying a discriminator network as a universal loss function for common supervised tasks (e.g. semantic segmentation, line detection, depth estimation) is considerably less successful. We argue that the main difficulty of applying CGANs to supervised tasks is that the generator training consists of optimizing a loss function that does not depend directly on the ground truth labels. To overcome this, we propose to replace the discriminator with a matching network taking into account both the ground truth outputs as well as the generated examples. As a consequence, the generator loss function also depends on the targets of the training examples, thus facilitating learning. We demonstrate on three computer vision tasks that this approach can significantly outperform CGANs achieving comparable or superior results to task-specific solutions and results in stable training. Importantly, this is a general approach that does not require the use of task-specific loss functions.

    * Abstract: We propose drl-RPN, a deep reinforcement learning-based visual recognition model consisting of a sequential region proposal network (RPN) and an object detector. In contrast to typical RPNs, where candidate object regions (RoIs) are selected greedily via class-agnostic NMS, drl-RPN optimizes an objective closer to the final detection task. This is achieved by replacing the greedy RoI selection process with a sequential attention mechanism which is trained via deep reinforcement learning (RL). Our model is capable of accumulating class-specific evidence over time, potentially affecting subsequent proposals and classification scores, and we show that such context integration significantly boosts detection accuracy. Moreover, drl-RPN automatically decides when to stop the search process and has the benefit of being able to jointly learn the parameters of the policy and the detector, both represented as deep networks. Our model can further learn to search over a wide range of exploration-accuracy trade-offs making it possible to specify or adapt the exploration extent at test time. The resulting search trajectories are image- and category-dependent, yet rely only on a single policy over all object categories. Results on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC challenges show that our approach outperforms established, typical state-of-the-art object detection pipelines.

    * Abstract: This paper introduces the first minimal solvers that jointly solve for affine-rectification and radial lens distortion from coplanar repeated patterns. Even with imagery from moderately distorted lenses, plane rectification using the pinhole camera model is inaccurate or invalid. The proposed solvers incorporate lens distortion into the camera model and extend accurate rectification to wide-angle imagery, which is now common from consumer cameras. The solvers are derived from constraints induced by the conjugate translations of an imaged scene plane, which are integrated with the division model for radial lens distortion. The hidden-variable trick with ideal saturation is used to reformulate the constraints so that the solvers generated by the Gr{\"o}bner-basis method are stable, small and fast. The proposed solvers are used in a RANSAC-based estimator. Rectification and lens distortion are recovered from either one conjugately translated affine-covariant feature or two independently translated similarity-covariant features. Experiments confirm that RANSAC accurately estimates the rectification and radial distortion with very few iterations. The proposed solvers are evaluated against the state-of-the-art for affine rectification and radial distortion estimation.

    * Abstract: We present Im2Pano3D, a convolutional neural network that generates a dense prediction of 3D structure and a probability distribution of semantic labels for a full 360 panoramic view of an indoor scene when given only a partial observation ( <=50%) in the form of an RGB-D image. To make this possible, Im2Pano3D leverages strong contextual priors learned from large-scale synthetic and real-world indoor scenes. To ease the prediction of 3D structure, we propose to parameterize 3D surfaces with their plane equations and train the model to predict these parameters directly. To provide meaningful training supervision, we make use of multiple loss functions that consider both pixel level accuracy and global context consistency. Experiments demonstrate that Im2Pano3D is able to predict the semantics and 3D structure of the unobserved scene with more than 56% pixel accuracy and less than 0.52m average distance error, which is significantly better than alternative approaches.

    * Abstract: We tackle the problem of point cloud recognition. Unlike previous approaches where a point cloud is either converted into a volume/image or represented independently in a permutation-invariant set, we develop a new representation by adopting the concept of shape context as the building block in our network design. The resulting model, called ShapeContextNet, consists of a hierarchy with modules not relying on a fixed grid while still enjoying properties similar to those in convolutional neural networks --- being able to capture and propagate the object part information. In addition, we find inspiration from self-attention based models to include a simple yet effective contextual modeling mechanism --- making the contextual region selection, the feature aggregation, and the feature transformation process fully automatic. ShapeContextNet is an end-to-end model that can be applied to the general point cloud classification and segmentation problems. We observe competitive results on a number of benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Supervoxels are perceptually meaningful atomic regions in videos, obtained by grouping voxels that exhibit coherence in both appearance and motion. In this paper, we propose content-sensitive supervoxels (CSS), which are regularly-shaped 3D primitive volumes that possess the following characteristic: they are typically larger and longer in content-sparse regions (i.e., with homogeneous appearance and motion), and smaller and shorter in content-dense regions (i.e., with high variation of appearance and/or motion). To compute CSS, we map a video X to a 3-dimensional manifold M embedded in R^6, whose volume elements give a good measure of the content density in X. We propose an efficient Lloyd-like method with a splitting-merging scheme to compute a uniform tessellation on M, which induces the CSS in X. Theoretically our method has a good competitive ratio O(1). We also present a simple extension of CSS to stream CSS for processing long videos that cannot be loaded into main memory at once. We evaluate CSS, stream CSS and seven representative supervoxel methods on four video datasets. The results show that our method outperforms existing supervoxel methods.

    * Abstract: Signature verification task needs relevant signature representations to achieve low error rates. Many signature representations have been proposed so far. In this work we propose a hybrid user-independent/dependent offline signature verification technique with a two-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) both for verification and feature extraction. Signature pairs are input to the CNN as two channels of one image, where the first channel always represents a reference signature and the second channel represents a query signature. We decrease the image size through the network by keeping the convolution stride parameter large enough. Global average pooling is applied to decrease the dimensionality to 200 at the end of locally connected layers. We utilize the CNN as a feature extractor and report 4.13% equal error rate (EER) considering 12 reference signatures with the proposed 200-dimensional representation, compared to 3.66% of a recently proposed technique with 2048-dimensional representation using the same experimental protocol. When the two methods are combined at score level, more than 50% improvement (1.76% EER) is achieved demonstrating the complementarity of them. Sensitivity of the model to gray-level and binary images is investigated in detail. One model is trained using gray-level images and the other is trained using binary images. It is shown that the availability of gray-level information in train and test data decreases the EER e.g. from 11.86% to 4.13%.

    * Abstract: Estimating the number of soccer players is crucial information for occupancy analysis and other monitoring activities in sports analysis. It depends on player detection in the field that should be independent of the environment and light conditions. Thermal cameras are therefore a better option over normal RGB cameras. Detection of non-occluded players is doable but precise estimation of number of the players in groups is hard to achieve. Here we propose a novel method for estimating number of the players in groups using computer graphics and virtual simulations. Occlusion conditions are first classified by using distinctive set of features trained by a bagged tree classifier. Estimation of the number of players is then performed by maximum likelihood of probability density based approach to further classify the occluded players. The results show that the implemented strategy is capable of providing precise results even during occlusion conditions.

    * Abstract: The most common approaches to instance segmentation are complex and use two-stage networks with object proposals, conditional random-fields, template matching or recurrent neural networks. In this work we present TernausNetV2 - a simple fully convolutional network that allows extracting objects from a high-resolution satellite imagery on an instance level. The network has popular encoder-decoder type of architecture with skip connections but has a few essential modifications that allows using for semantic as well as for instance segmentation tasks. This approach is universal and allows to extend any network that has been successfully applied for semantic segmentation to perform instance segmentation task. In addition, we generalize network encoder that was pre-trained for RGB images to use additional input channels. It makes possible to use transfer learning from visual to a wider spectral range. For DeepGlobe-CVPR 2018 building detection sub-challenge, based on public leaderboard score, our approach shows superior performance in comparison to other methods.

    * Abstract: Road extraction is a fundamental task in the field of remote sensing which has been a hot research topic in the past decade. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation neural network, named D-LinkNet, which adopts encoder-decoder structure, dilated convolution and pretrained encoder for road extraction task. The network is built with LinkNet architecture and has dilated convolution layers in its center part. Linknet architecture is efficient in computation and memory. Dilation convolution is a powerful tool that can enlarge the receptive field of feature points without reducing the resolution of the feature maps.

    * Abstract: The detection of anomalous structures in natural image data is of utmost importance for numerous tasks in the field of computer vision. The development of methods for unsupervised anomaly detection requires data on which to train and evaluate new approaches and ideas. We introduce the MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec AD) dataset containing 5354 high-resolution color images of different object and texture categories. It contains normal, i.e., defect-free, images intended for training and images with anomalies intended for testing. The anomalies manifest themselves in the form of over 70 different types of defects such as scratches, dents, contaminations, and various structural changes. In addition, we provide pixel-precise ground truth regions for all anomalies. We also conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods based on deep architectures such as convolutional autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and feature descriptors using pre-trained convolutional neural networks, as well as classical computer vision methods. This initial benchmark indicates that there is considerable room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive, multi-object, multi-defect dataset for anomaly detection that provides pixel-accurate ground truth regions and focuses on real-world applications.

    * Abstract: Grasping and manipulating objects is an important human skill. Since hand-object contact is fundamental to grasping, capturing it can lead to important insights. However, observing contact through external sensors is challenging because of occlusion and the complexity of the human hand. We present ContactDB, a novel dataset of contact maps for household objects that captures the rich hand-object contact that occurs during grasping, enabled by use of a thermal camera. Participants in our study grasped 3D printed objects with a post-grasp functional intent. ContactDB includes 3750 3D meshes of 50 household objects textured with contact maps and 375K frames of synchronized RGB-D+thermal images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset that records detailed contact maps for human grasps. Analysis of this data shows the influence of functional intent and object size on grasping, the tendency to touch/avoid 'active areas', and the high frequency of palm and proximal finger contact. Finally, we train state-of-the art image translation and 3D convolution algorithms to predict diverse contact patterns from object shape.

    * Abstract: We present Argoverse, a dataset designed to support autonomous vehicle perception tasks including 3D tracking and motion forecasting. Argoverse includes sensor data collected by a fleet of autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh and Miami as well as 3D tracking annotations, 300k extracted interesting vehicle trajectories, and rich semantic maps. The sensor data consists of 360 degree images from 7 cameras with overlapping fields of view, forward-facing stereo imagery, 3D point clouds from long range LiDAR, and 6-DOF pose. Our 290km of mapped lanes contain rich geometric and semantic metadata which are not currently available in any public dataset. All data is released under a Creative Commons license at Argoverse.org. In baseline experiments, we use map information such as lane direction, driveable area, and ground height to improve the accuracy of 3D object tracking. We use 3D object tracking to mine for more than 300k interesting vehicle trajectories to create a trajectory forecasting benchmark. Motion forecasting experiments ranging in complexity from classical methods (k-NN) to LSTMs demonstrate that using detailed vector maps with lane-level information substantially reduces prediction error. Our tracking and forecasting experiments represent only a superficial exploration of the potential of rich maps in robotic perception. We hope that Argoverse will enable the research community to explore these problems in greater depth.

    * Authors: Dominic Cheng,  Renjie Liao,  Sanja Fidler,  Raquel Urtasun
    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Deep Active Ray Network (DARNet) for automatic building segmentation. Taking an image as input, it first exploits a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone to predict energy maps, which are further utilized to construct an energy function. A polygon-based contour is then evolved via minimizing the energy function, of which the minimum defines the final segmentation. Instead of parameterizing the contour using Euclidean coordinates, we adopt polar coordinates, i.e., rays, which not only prevents self-intersection but also simplifies the design of the energy function. Moreover, we propose a loss function that directly encourages the contours to match building boundaries. Our DARNet is trained end-to-end by back-propagating through the energy minimization and the backbone CNN, which makes the CNN adapt to the dynamics of the contour evolution. Experiments on three building instance segmentation datasets demonstrate our DARNet achieves either state-of-the-art or comparable performances to other competitors.

    * Abstract: Common object counting in a natural scene is a challenging problem in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. Existing image-level supervised common object counting approaches only predict the global object count and rely on additional instance-level supervision to also determine object locations. We propose an image-level supervised approach that provides both the global object count and the spatial distribution of object instances by constructing an object category density map. Motivated by psychological studies, we further reduce image-level supervision using a limited object count information (up to four). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose image-level supervised density map estimation for common object counting and demonstrate its effectiveness in image-level supervised instance segmentation. Comprehensive experiments are performed on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. Our approach outperforms existing methods, including those using instance-level supervision, on both datasets for common object counting. Moreover, our approach improves state-of-the-art image-level supervised instance segmentation with a relative gain of 17.8% in terms of average best overlap, on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

    * Authors: Ciprian A. Corneanu,  Meysam Madadi,  Sergio Escalera,  Aleix M. Martinez
    * Abstract: The flexibility and high-accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has transformed computer vision. But, the fact that we do not know when a specific DNN will work and when it will fail has resulted in a lack of trust. A clear example is self-driving cars; people are uncomfortable sitting in a car driven by algorithms that may fail under some unknown, unpredictable conditions. Interpretability and explainability approaches attempt to address this by uncovering what a DNN models, i.e., what each node (cell) in the network represents and what images are most likely to activate it. This can be used to generate, for example, adversarial attacks. But these approaches do not generally allow us to determine where a DNN will succeed or fail and why . i.e., does this learned representation generalize to unseen samples? Here, we derive a novel approach to define what it means to learn in deep networks, and how to use this knowledge to detect adversarial attacks. We show how this defines the ability of a network to generalize to unseen testing samples and, most importantly, why this is the case.

    * Abstract: The question whether one can recover the shape of a geometric object from its Laplacian spectrum ('hear the shape of the drum') is a classical problem in spectral geometry with a broad range of implications and applications. While theoretically the answer to this question is negative (there exist examples of iso-spectral but non-isometric manifolds), little is known about the practical possibility of using the spectrum for shape reconstruction and optimization. In this paper, we introduce a numerical procedure called isospectralization, consisting of deforming one shape to make its Laplacian spectrum match that of another. We implement the isospectralization procedure using modern differentiable programming techniques and exemplify its applications in some of the classical and notoriously hard problems in geometry processing, computer vision, and graphics such as shape reconstruction, pose and style transfer, and dense deformable correspondence.

    * Abstract: Standard RGB-D trackers treat the target as a 2D structure, which makes modelling appearance changes related even to out-of-plane rotation challenging. This limitation is addressed by the proposed long-term RGB-D tracker called OTR - Object Tracking by Reconstruction. OTR performs online 3D target reconstruction to facilitate robust learning of a set of view-specific discriminative correlation filters (DCFs). The 3D reconstruction supports two performance- enhancing features: (i) generation of an accurate spatial support for constrained DCF learning from its 2D projection and (ii) point-cloud based estimation of 3D pose change for selection and storage of view-specific DCFs which robustly localize the target after out-of-view rotation or heavy occlusion. Extensive evaluation on the Princeton RGB-D tracking and STC Benchmarks shows OTR outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

    * Abstract: We present a convolutional network architecture for direct feature learning on mesh surfaces through their atlases of texture maps. The texture map encodes the parameterization from 3D to 2D domain, rendering not only RGB values but also rasterized geometric features if necessary. Since the parameterization of texture map is not pre-determined, and depends on the surface topologies, we therefore introduce a novel cross-atlas convolution to recover the original mesh geodesic neighborhood, so as to achieve the invariance property to arbitrary parameterization. The proposed module is integrated into classification and segmentation architectures, which takes the input texture map of a mesh, and infers the output predictions. Our method not only shows competitive performances on classification and segmentation public benchmarks, but also paves the way for the broad mesh surfaces learning.

    * Abstract: Many applications in robotics and human-computer interaction can benefit from understanding 3D motion of points in a dynamic environment, widely noted as scene flow. While most previous methods focus on stereo and RGB-D images as input, few try to estimate scene flow directly from point clouds. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network named FlowNet3D that learns scene flow from point clouds in an end-to-end fashion. Our network simultaneously learns deep hierarchical features of point clouds and flow embeddings that represent point motions, supported by two newly proposed learning layers for point sets. We evaluate the network on both challenging synthetic data from FlyingThings3D and real Lidar scans from KITTI. Trained on synthetic data only, our network successfully generalizes to real scans, outperforming various baselines and showing competitive results to the prior art. We also demonstrate two applications of our scene flow output (scan registration and motion segmentation) to show its potential wide use cases.

    * Abstract: With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based approaches for 3D reconstruction have gained popularity. However, unlike for images, in 3D there is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstruction approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a restricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a new representation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution without excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation can efficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of input. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single images, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids. We believe that occupancy networks will become a useful tool in a wide variety of learning-based 3D tasks.

We build on recent developments in algorithms for absolute and relative pose recovery for generalised cameras and couple them with multi-view triangulation in a robust framework that advances the state-of-the-art on 3D reconstruction from LFs in several ways. First, our framework can recover the scale of a scene. Second, it is concerned with unordered sets of LF images, meticulously determining the order in which images should be considered. Third, it can scale to datasets with hundreds of LF images. Finally, it recovers 3D scene structure while abstaining from triangulating using very small baselines. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, as demonstrated by real-world experiments with variable size datasets.

    * Abstract: With the growing use of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) comes the need for explainability. In this paper, we introduce explainability methods for GCNNs. We develop the graph analogues of three prominent explainability methods for convolutional neural networks: contrastive gradient-based (CG) saliency maps, Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and Excitation Back-Propagation (EB) and their variants, gradient-weighted CAM (Grad-CAM) and contrastive EB (c-EB). We show a proof-of-concept of these methods on classification problems in two application domains: visual scene graphs and molecular graphs. To compare the methods, we identify three desirable properties of explanations: (1) their importance to classification, as measured by the impact of occlusions, (2) their contrastivity with respect to different classes, and (3) their sparseness on a graph. We call the corresponding quantitative metrics fidelity, contrastivity, and sparsity and evaluate them for each method. Lastly, we analyze the salient subgraphs obtained from explanations and report frequently occurring patterns.

    * Abstract: The computer vision community has witnessed recent advances in scene categorization from images, with the state of the art systems now achieving impressive recognition rates on challenging benchmarks. Such systems have been trained on photographs which include color, texture and shading cues. The geometry of shapes and surfaces, as conveyed by scene contours, is not explicitly considered for this task. Remarkably, humans can accurately recognize natural scenes from line drawings, which consist solely of contour-based shape cues. Here we report the first computer vision study on scene categorization of line drawings derived from popular databases including an artist scene database, MIT67 and Places365. Specifically, we use off-the-shelf pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform scene classification given only contour information as input, and find performance levels well above chance. We also show that medial-axis based contour salience methods can be used to select more informative subsets of contour pixels, and that the variation in CNN classification performance on various choices for these subsets is qualitatively similar to that observed in human performance. Moreover, when the salience measures are used to weight the contours, we find that these weights boost our CNN performance above that for unweighted contour input. That is, the medial axis based salience weights appear to add useful information that is not available when CNNs are trained to use contours alone.

    * Abstract: Robust and accurate visual localization is a fundamental capability for numerous applications, such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, or augmented reality. It remains, however, a challenging task, particularly for large-scale environments and in presence of significant appearance changes. State-of-the-art methods not only struggle with such scenarios, but are often too resource intensive for certain real-time applications. In this paper we propose HF-Net, a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that simultaneously predicts local features and global descriptors for accurate 6-DoF localization. We exploit the coarse-to-fine localization paradigm: we first perform a global retrieval to obtain location hypotheses and only later match local features within those candidate places. This hierarchical approach incurs significant runtime savings and makes our system suitable for real-time operation. By leveraging learned descriptors, our method achieves remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance and sets a new state-of-the-art on two challenging benchmarks for large-scale localization.

    * Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to discover near duplicate patterns in large collections of artworks. This is harder than standard instance mining due to differences in the artistic media (oil, pastel, drawing, etc), and imperfections inherent in the copying process. Our key technical insight is to adapt a standard deep feature to this task by fine-tuning it on the specific art collection using self-supervised learning. More specifically, spatial consistency between neighbouring feature matches is used as supervisory fine-tuning signal. The adapted feature leads to more accurate style invariant matching, and can be used with a standard discovery approach, based on geometric verification, to identify duplicate patterns in the dataset. The approach is evaluated on several different datasets and shows surprisingly good qualitative discovery results. For quantitative evaluation of the method, we annotated 273 near duplicate details in a dataset of 1587 artworks attributed to Jan Brueghel and his workshop. Beyond artworks, we also demonstrate improvement on localization on the Oxford5K photo dataset as well as on historical photograph localization on the Large Time Lags Location (LTLL) dataset.

    * Abstract: Indoor scenes exhibit rich hierarchical structure in 3D object layouts. Many tasks in 3D scene understanding can benefit from reasoning jointly about the hierarchical context of a scene, and the identities of objects. We present a variational denoising recursive autoencoder (VDRAE) that generates and iteratively refines a hierarchical representation of 3D object layouts, interleaving bottom-up encoding for context aggregation and top-down decoding for propagation. We train our VDRAE on large-scale 3D scene datasets to predict both instance-level segmentations and a 3D object detections from an over-segmentation of an input point cloud. We show that our VDRAE improves object detection performance on real-world 3D point cloud datasets compared to baselines from prior work.

    * Authors: Krishna Kumar Singh,  Yong Jae Lee
    * Abstract: We propose a novel way of using videos to obtain high precision object proposals for weakly-supervised object detection. Existing weakly-supervised detection approaches use off-the-shelf proposal methods like edge boxes or selective search to obtain candidate boxes. These methods provide high recall but at the expense of thousands of noisy proposals. Thus, the entire burden of finding the few relevant object regions is left to the ensuing object mining step. To mitigate this issue, we focus instead on improving the precision of the initial candidate object proposals. Since we cannot rely on localization annotations, we turn to video and leverage motion cues to automatically estimate the extent of objects to train a Weakly-supervised Region Proposal Network (W-RPN). We use the W-RPN to generate high precision object proposals, which are in turn used to re-rank high recall proposals like edge boxes or selective search according to their spatial overlap. Our W-RPN proposals lead to significant improvement in performance for state-of-the-art weakly-supervised object detection approaches on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose Text2Scene, a model that generates various forms of compositional scene representations from natural language descriptions. Unlike recent works, our method does NOT use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Text2Scene instead learns to sequentially generate objects and their attributes (location, size, appearance, etc) at every time step by attending to different parts of the input text and the current status of the generated scene. We show that under minor modifications, the proposed framework can handle the generation of different forms of scene representations, including cartoon-like scenes, object layouts corresponding to real images, and synthetic images. Our method is not only competitive when compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based methods using automatic metrics and superior based on human judgments but also has the advantage of producing interpretable results.

    * Abstract: We address the problem of detecting scene text in arbitrary shapes, which is a challenging task due to the high variety and complexity of the scene. Specifically, we treat text detection as instance segmentation and propose a segmentation-based framework, which extracts each text instance as an independent connected component. To distinguish different text instances, our method maps pixels onto an embedding space where pixels belonging to the same text are encouraged to appear closer to each other and vise versa. In addition, we introduce a Shape-Aware Loss to make training adaptively accommodate various aspect ratios of text instances and the tiny gaps among them, and a new post-processing pipeline to yield precise bounding box predictions. Experimental results on three challenging datasets (ICDAR15, MSRA-TD500 and CTW1500) demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection attracts much attention in computer vision, because it can be widely used in many applications such as real-time text translation, automatic information entry, blind person assistance, robot sensing and so on. Though many methods have been proposed for horizontal and oriented texts, detecting irregular shape texts such as curved texts is still a challenging problem. To solve the problem, we propose a robust scene text detection method with adaptive text region representation. Given an input image, a text region proposal network is first used for extracting text proposals. Then, these proposals are verified and refined with a refinement network. Here, recurrent neural network based adaptive text region representation is proposed for text region refinement, where a pair of boundary points are predicted each time step until no new points are found. In this way, text regions of arbitrary shapes are detected and represented with adaptive number of boundary points. This gives more accurate description of text regions. Experimental results on five benchmarks, namely, CTW1500, TotalText, ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015 and MSRA-TD500, show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art in scene text detection.

    * Abstract: Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is a highly portable graphics format that is ubiquitous on the Internet. Despite their small sizes, GIF images often contain undesirable visual artifacts such as flat color regions, false contours, color shift, and dotted patterns. In this paper, we propose GIF2Video, the first learning-based method for enhancing the visual quality of GIFs in the wild. We focus on the challenging task of GIF restoration by recovering information lost in the three steps of GIF creation: frame sampling, color quantization, and color dithering. We first propose a novel CNN architecture for color dequantization. It is built upon a compositional architecture for multi-step color correction, with a comprehensive loss function designed to handle large quantization errors. We then adapt the SuperSlomo network for temporal interpolation of GIF frames. We introduce two large datasets, namely GIF-Faces and GIF-Moments, for both training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the visual quality of GIFs, and outperforms direct baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.

    * Authors: Jialiang Wang,  Todd Zickler
    * Abstract: Stereo occlusion boundaries are one-dimensional structures in the visual field that separate foreground regions of a scene that are visible to both eyes (binocular regions) from background regions of a scene that are visible to only one eye (monocular regions). Stereo occlusion boundaries often coincide with object boundaries, and localizing them is useful for tasks like grasping, manipulation, and navigation. This paper describes the local signatures for stereo occlusion boundaries that exist in a stereo cost volume, and it introduces a local detector for them based on a simple feedforward network with relatively small receptive fields. The local detector produces better boundaries than many other stereo methods, even without incorporating explicit stereo matching, top-down contextual cues, or single-image boundary cues based on texture and intensity.

    * Abstract: Text effects transfer can dramatically make the text visually pleasing. In this paper, we present a novel framework to stylize the text with exquisite decor, which is ignored by the previous text stylization methods. Decorative elements pose a challenge to spontaneously handle basal text effects and decor, which are two different styles. To address this issue, our key idea is to learn to separate, transfer and recombine the decors and the basal text effect. A novel text effect transfer network is proposed to infer the styled version of the target text. The stylized text is finally embellished with decor where the placement of the decor is carefully determined by a novel structure-aware strategy. Furthermore, we propose a domain adaptation strategy for decor detection and a one-shot training strategy for text effects transfer, which greatly enhance the robustness of our network to new styles. We base our experiments on our collected topography dataset including 59,000 professionally styled text and demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art style transfer methods.

The key contributions of this paper are: 1) an application of viewing and animating humans in single photos in 3D, 2) a novel 2D warping method to deform a posable template body model to fit the person's complex silhouette to create an animatable mesh, and 3) a method for handling partial self occlusions. We compare to state-of-the-art related methods and evaluate results with human studies. Further, we present an interactive interface that allows re-posing the person in 3D, and an augmented reality setup where the animated 3D person can emerge from the photo into the real world. We demonstrate the method on photos, posters, and art. The project page is at https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/wakeup/.

    * Abstract: The reconstruction of a discrete surface from a point cloud is a fundamental geometry processing problem that has been studied for decades, with many methods developed. We propose the use of a deep neural network as a geometric prior for surface reconstruction. Specifically, we overfit a neural network representing a local chart parameterization to part of an input point cloud using the Wasserstein distance as a measure of approximation. By jointly fitting many such networks to overlapping parts of the point cloud, while enforcing a consistency condition, we compute a manifold atlas. By sampling this atlas, we can produce a dense reconstruction of the surface approximating the input cloud. The entire procedure does not require any training data or explicit regularization, yet, we show that it is able to perform remarkably well: not introducing typical overfitting artifacts, and approximating sharp features closely at the same time. We experimentally show that this geometric prior produces good results for both man-made objects containing sharp features and smoother organic objects, as well as noisy inputs. We compare our method with a number of well-known reconstruction methods on a standard surface reconstruction benchmark.

    * Abstract: Existing image inpainting methods typically fill holes by borrowing information from surrounding pixels. They often produce unsatisfactory results when the holes overlap with or touch foreground objects due to lack of information about the actual extent of foreground and background regions within the holes. These scenarios, however, are very important in practice, especially for applications such as distracting object removal. To address the problem, we propose a foreground-aware image inpainting system that explicitly disentangles structure inference and content completion. Specifically, our model learns to predict the foreground contour first, and then inpaints the missing region using the predicted contour as guidance. We show that by such disentanglement, the contour completion model predicts reasonable contours of objects, and further substantially improves the performance of image inpainting. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves superior inpainting results on challenging cases with complex compositions.

    * Abstract: We present a deep learning framework, called DuLa-Net, to predict Manhattan-world 3D room layouts from a single RGB panorama. To achieve better prediction accuracy, our method leverages two projections of the panorama at once, namely the equirectangular panorama-view and the perspective ceiling-view, that each contains different clues about the room layouts. Our network architecture consists of two encoder-decoder branches for analyzing each of the two views. In addition, a novel feature fusion structure is proposed to connect the two branches, which are then jointly trained to predict the 2D floor plans and layout heights. To learn more complex room layouts, we introduce the Realtor360 dataset that contains panoramas of Manhattan-world room layouts with different numbers of corners. Experimental results show that our work outperforms recent state-of-the-art in prediction accuracy and performance, especially in the rooms with non-cuboid layouts.

    * Abstract: Automated recognition of texts in scenes has been a research challenge for years, largely due to the arbitrary text appearance variation in perspective distortion, text line curvature, text styles and different types of imaging artifacts. The recent deep networks are capable of learning robust representations with respect to imaging artifacts and text style changes, but still face various problems while dealing with scene texts with perspective and curvature distortions. This paper presents an end-to-end trainable scene text recognition system (ESIR) that iteratively removes perspective distortion and text line curvature as driven by better scene text recognition performance. An innovative rectification network is developed, where a line-fitting transformation is designed to estimate the pose of text lines in scenes. Additionally, an iterative rectification framework is developed which corrects scene text distortions iteratively towards a fronto-parallel view. The ESIR is also robust to parameter initialization and easy to train, where the training needs only scene text images and word-level annotations as required by most scene text recognition systems. Extensive experiments over a number of public datasets show that the proposed ESIR is capable of rectifying scene text distortions accurately, achieving superior recognition performance for both normal scene text images and those suffering from perspective and curvature distortions.

    * Abstract: Accurate microcalcification (mC) detection is of great importance due to its high proportion in early breast cancers. Most of the previous mC detection methods belong to discriminative models, where classifiers are exploited to distinguish mCs from other backgrounds. However, it is still challenging for these methods to tell the mCs from amounts of normal tissues because they are too tiny (at most 14 pixels). Generative methods can precisely model the normal tissues and regard the abnormal ones as outliers, while they fail to further distinguish the mCs from other anomalies, i.e. vessel calcifications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach by taking advantages of both generative and discriminative models. Firstly, a generative model named Anomaly Separation Network (ASN) is used to generate candidate mCs. ASN contains two major components. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder network is built to learn the image reconstruction mapping and a t-test loss function is designed to separate the distributions of the reconstruction residuals of mCs from normal tissues. Secondly, a discriminative model is cascaded to tell the mCs from the false positives. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public and in-house datasets, which demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: Hundreds of materials, such as drugs, explosives, makeup, food additives, are in the form of powder. Recognizing such powders is important for security checks, criminal identification, drug control, and quality assessment. However, powder recognition has drawn little attention in the computer vision community. Powders are hard to distinguish: they are amorphous, appear matte, have little color or texture variation and blend with surfaces they are deposited on in complex ways. To address these challenges, we present the first comprehensive dataset and approach for powder recognition using multi-spectral imaging. By using Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) multi-spectral imaging together with visible light (RGB) and Near Infrared (NIR), powders can be discriminated with reasonable accuracy. We present a method to select discriminative spectral bands to significantly reduce acquisition time while improving recognition accuracy. We propose a blending model to synthesize images of powders of various thickness deposited on a wide range of surfaces. Incorporating band selection and image synthesis, we conduct fine-grained recognition of 100 powders on complex backgrounds, and achieve 60% 70% accuracy on recognition with known powder location, and over 40% mean IoU without known location.

    * Abstract: We introduce a powerful student-teacher framework for the challenging problem of unsupervised anomaly detection and pixel-precise anomaly segmentation in high-resolution images. Student networks are trained to regress the output of a descriptive teacher network that was pretrained on a large dataset of patches from natural images. This circumvents the need for prior data annotation. Anomalies are detected when the outputs of the student networks differ from that of the teacher network. This happens when they fail to generalize outside the manifold of anomaly-free training data. The intrinsic uncertainty in the student networks is used as an additional scoring function that indicates anomalies. We compare our method to a large number of existing deep learning based methods for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods on a number of real-world datasets, including the recently introduced MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset that was specifically designed to benchmark anomaly segmentation algorithms.

    * Abstract: Graphs offer a natural way to formulate Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) within the tracking-by-detection paradigm. However, they also introduce a major challenge for learning methods, as defining a model that can operate on such structured domain is not trivial. As a consequence, most learning-based work has been devoted to learning better features for MOT and then using these with well-established optimization frameworks. In this work, we exploit the classical network flow formulation of MOT to define a fully differentiable framework based on Message Passing Networks (MPNs). By operating directly on the graph domain, our method can reason globally over an entire set of detections and predict final solutions. Hence, we show that learning in MOT does not need to be restricted to feature extraction, but it can also be applied to the data association step. We show a significant improvement in both MOTA and IDF1 on three publicly available benchmarks. Our code is available at https://bit.ly/motsolv.

    * Abstract: We combine ideas from shock graph theory with more recent appearance-based methods for medial axis extraction from complex natural scenes, improving upon the present best unsupervised method, in terms of efficiency and performance. We make the following specific contributions: i) we extend the shock graph representation to the domain of real images, by generalizing the shock type definitions using local, appearance-based criteria; ii) we then use the rules of a Shock Grammar to guide our search for medial points, drastically reducing run time when compared to other methods, which exhaustively consider all points in the input image; iii) we remove the need for typical post-processing steps including thinning, non-maximum suppression, and grouping, by adhering to the Shock Grammar rules while deriving the medial axis solution; iv) finally, we raise some fundamental concerns with the evaluation scheme used in previous work and propose a more appropriate alternative for assessing the performance of medial axis extraction from scenes. Our experiments on the BMAX500 and SK-LARGE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We outperform the present state-of-the-art, excelling particularly in the high-precision regime, while running an order of magnitude faster and requiring no post-processing.

    * Abstract: State-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods were almost exclusively trained on images within a fixed resolution range. These segmentations are inaccurate for very high-resolution images since using bicubic upsampling of low-resolution segmentation does not adequately capture high-resolution details along object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the high-resolution segmentation problem without using any high-resolution training data. The key insight is our CascadePSP network which refines and corrects local boundaries whenever possible. Although our network is trained with low-resolution segmentation data, our method is applicable to any resolution even for very high-resolution images larger than 4K. We present quantitative and qualitative studies on different datasets to show that CascadePSP can reveal pixel-accurate segmentation boundaries using our novel refinement module without any finetuning. Thus, our method can be regarded as class-agnostic. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our model to scene parsing in multi-class segmentation.

    * Authors: Ying Chen,  Chun-Guang Li,  Chong You
    * Abstract: State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods are based on self-expressive model, which represents each data point as a linear combination of other data points. By enforcing such representation to be sparse, sparse subspace clustering is guaranteed to produce a subspace-preserving data affinity where two points are connected only if they are from the same subspace. On the other hand, however, data points from the same subspace may not be well-connected, leading to the issue of over-segmentation. We introduce dropout to address the issue of over-segmentation, which is based on randomly dropping out data points in self-expressive model. In particular, we show that dropout is equivalent to adding a squared l_2 norm regularization on the representation coefficients, therefore induces denser solutions. Then, we reformulate the optimization problem as a consensus problem over a set of small-scale subproblems. This leads to a scalable and flexible sparse subspace clustering approach, termed Stochastic Sparse Subspace Clustering, which can effectively handle large scale datasets. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real world datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposal.

    * Authors: Kyu-Yul Lee,  Jae-Young Sim
    * Abstract: Image stitching techniques align two images captured at different viewing positions onto a single wider image. When the captured 3D scene is not planar and the camera baseline is large, two images exhibit parallax where the relative positions of scene structures are quite different from each view. The existing image stitching methods often fail to work on the images with large parallax. In this paper, we propose an image stitching algorithm robust to large parallax based on the novel concept of warping residuals. We first estimate multiple homographies and find their inlier feature matches between two images. Then we evaluate warping residual for each feature match with respect to the multiple homographies. To alleviate the parallax artifacts, we partition input images into superpixels and warp each superpixel adaptively according to an optimal homography which is computed by minimizing the error of feature matches weighted by the warping residuals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for images with large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Our experiments on the challenging Cityscapes dataset show that our PolyTransform significantly improves the performance of the backbone instance segmentation network and ranks 1st on the Cityscapes test-set leaderboard. We also show impressive gains in the interactive annotation setting.

    * Abstract: Template-based discriminative trackers are currently the dominant tracking paradigm due to their robustness, but are restricted to bounding box tracking and a limited range of transformation models, which reduces their localization accuracy. We propose a discriminative single-shot segmentation tracker - D3S, which narrows the gap between visual object tracking and video object segmentation. A single-shot network applies two target models with complementary geometric properties, one invariant to a broad range of transformations, including non-rigid deformations, the other assuming a rigid object to simultaneously achieve high robustness and online target segmentation. Without per-dataset finetuning and trained only for segmentation as the primary output, D3S outperforms all trackers on VOT2016, VOT2018 and GOT-10k benchmarks and performs close to the state-of-the-art trackers on the TrackingNet. D3S outperforms the leading segmentation tracker SiamMask on video segmentation benchmark and performs on par with top video object segmentation algorithms, while running an order of magnitude faster, close to real-time.

    * Authors: Sida Peng,  Wen Jiang,  Huaijin Pi,  Xiuli Li,  Hujun Bao,  Xiaowei Zhou
    * Abstract: This paper introduces a novel contour-based approach named deep snake for real-time instance segmentation. Unlike some recent methods that directly regress the coordinates of the object boundary points from an image, deep snake uses a neural network to iteratively deform an initial contour to match the object boundary, which implements the classic idea of snake algorithms with a learning-based approach. For structured feature learning on the contour, we propose to use circular convolution in deep snake, which better exploits the cycle-graph structure of a contour compared against generic graph convolution. Based on deep snake, we develop a two-stage pipeline for instance segmentation: initial contour proposal and contour deformation, which can handle errors in object localization. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves competitive performances on the Cityscapes, KINS, SBD and COCO datasets while being efficient for real-time applications with a speed of 32.3 fps for 512 x 512 images on a 1080Ti GPU.

    * Abstract: We propose a method for creating a matte - the per-pixel foreground color and alpha - of a person by taking photos or videos in an everyday setting with a handheld camera. Most existing matting methods require a green screen background or a manually created trimap to produce a good matte. Automatic, trimap-free methods are appearing, but are not of comparable quality. In our trimap free approach, we ask the user to take an additional photo of the background without the subject at the time of capture. This step requires a small amount of foresight but is far less timeconsuming than creating a trimap. We train a deep network with an adversarial loss to predict the matte. We first train a matting network with a supervised loss on ground truth data with synthetic composites. To bridge the domain gap to real imagery with no labeling, we train another matting network guided by the first network and by a discriminator that judges the quality of composites. We demonstrate results on a wide variety of photos and videos and show significant improvement over the state of the art.

We use a Layered Depth Image with explicit pixel connectivity as underlying representation, and present a learning-based inpainting model that iteratively synthesizes new local color-and-depth content into the occluded region in a spatial context-aware manner. The resulting 3D photos can be efficiently rendered with motion parallax using standard graphics engines. We validate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of challenging everyday scenes and show less artifacts when compared with the state-of-the-arts.

    * Abstract: Many tasks in graphics and vision demand machinery for converting shapes into consistent representations with sparse sets of parameters; these representations facilitate rendering, editing, and storage. When the source data is noisy or ambiguous, however, artists and engineers often manually construct such representations, a tedious and potentially time-consuming process. While advances in deep learning have been successfully applied to noisy geometric data, the task of generating parametric shapes has so far been difficult for these methods. Hence, we propose a new framework for predicting parametric shape primitives using deep learning. We use distance fields to transition between shape parameters like control points and input data on a pixel grid. We demonstrate efficacy on 2D and 3D tasks, including font vectorization and surface abstraction.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection has witnessed rapid development in recent years. However, there still exists two main challenges: 1) many methods suffer from false positives in their text representations; 2) the large scale variance of scene texts makes it hard for network to learn samples. In this paper, we propose the ContourNet, which effectively handles these two problems taking a further step toward accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection. At first, a scale-insensitive Adaptive Region Proposal Network (Adaptive-RPN) is proposed to generate text proposals by only focusing on the Intersection over Union (IoU) values between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes. Then a novel Local Orthogonal Texture-aware Module (LOTM) models the local texture information of proposal features in two orthogonal directions and represents text region with a set of contour points. Considering that the strong unidirectional or weakly orthogonal activation is usually caused by the monotonous texture characteristic of false-positive patterns (e.g. streaks.), our method effectively suppresses these false positives by only outputting predictions with high response value in both orthogonal directions. This gives more accurate description of text regions. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets (Total-Text, CTW1500 and ICDAR2015) verify that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

    * Abstract: The pursuit of high performance on public benchmarks has been the driving force for research in scene text recognition, and notable progresses have been achieved. However, a close investigation reveals a startling fact that the state-of-the-art methods perform well on images with words within vocabulary but generalize poorly to images with words outside vocabulary. We call this phenomenon "vocabulary reliance". In this paper, we establish an analytical framework, in which different datasets, metrics and module combinations for quantitative comparisons are devised, to conduct an in-depth study on the problem of vocabulary reliance in scene text recognition. Key findings include: (1) Vocabulary reliance is ubiquitous, i.e., all existing algorithms more or less exhibit such characteristic; (2) Attention-based decoders prove weak in generalizing to words outside vocabulary and segmentation-based decoders perform well in utilizing visual features; (3) Context modeling is highly coupled with the prediction layers. These findings provide new insights and can benefit future research in scene text recognition. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective mutual learning strategy to allow models of two families (attention-based and segmentation-based) to learn collaboratively. This remedy alleviates the problem of vocabulary reliance and significantly improves the overall scene text recognition performance.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an anchor-box free and single shot instance segmentation method, which is conceptually simple, fully convolutional and can be used by easily embedding it into most off-the-shelf detection methods. Our method, termed PolarMask, formulates the instance segmentation problem as predicting contour of instance through instance center classification and dense distance regression in a polar coordinate. Moreover, we propose two effective approaches to deal with sampling high-quality center examples and optimization for dense distance regression, respectively, which can significantly improve the performance and simplify the training process. Without any bells and whistles, PolarMask achieves 32.9% in mask mAP with single-model and single-scale training/testing on the challenging COCO dataset. For the first time, we show that the complexity of instance segmentation, in terms of both design and computation complexity, can be the same as bounding box object detection and this much simpler and flexible instance segmentation framework can achieve competitive accuracy. We hope that the proposed PolarMask framework can serve as a fundamental and strong baseline for single shot instance segmentation task.

    * Abstract: Arbitrary shape text detection is a challenging task due to the high variety and complexity of scenes texts. In this paper, we propose a novel unified relational reasoning graph network for arbitrary shape text detection. In our method, an innovative local graph bridges a text proposal model via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a deep relational reasoning network via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), making our network end-to-end trainable. To be concrete, every text instance will be divided into a series of small rectangular components, and the geometry attributes (e.g., height, width, and orientation) of the small components will be estimated by our text proposal model. Given the geometry attributes, the local graph construction model can roughly establish linkages between different text components. For further reasoning and deducing the likelihood of linkages between the component and its neighbors, we adopt a graph-based network to perform deep relational reasoning on local graphs. Experiments on public available datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/GXYM/DRRG.

    * Abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize objects with only image-level labels. Previous methods often try to utilize feature maps and classification weights to localize objects using image level annotations indirectly. In this paper, we demonstrate that weakly supervised object localization should be divided into two parts: class-agnostic object localization and object classification. For class-agnostic object localization, we should use class-agnostic methods to generate noisy pseudo annotations and then perform bounding box regression on them without class labels. We propose the pseudo supervised object localization (PSOL) method as a new way to solve WSOL. Our PSOL models have good transferability across different datasets without fine-tuning. With generated pseudo bounding boxes, we achieve 58.00% localization accuracy on ImageNet and 74.74% localization accuracy on CUB-200, which have a large edge over previous models.

    * Abstract: We introduce a deep generative network for 3D shape detailization, akin to stylization with the style being geometric details. We address the challenge of creating large varieties of high-resolution and detailed 3D geometry from a small set of exemplars by treating the problem as that of geometric detail transfer. Given a low-resolution coarse voxel shape, our network refines it, via voxel upsampling, into a higher-resolution shape enriched with geometric details. The output shape preserves the overall structure (or content) of the input, while its detail generation is conditioned on an input "style code" corresponding to a detailed exemplar. Our 3D detailization via conditional refinement is realized by a generative adversarial network, coined DECOR-GAN. The network utilizes a 3D CNN generator for upsampling coarse voxels and a 3D PatchGAN discriminator to enforce local patches of the generated model to be similar to those in the training detailed shapes. During testing, a style code is fed into the generator to condition the refinement. We demonstrate that our method can refine a coarse shape into a variety of detailed shapes with different styles. The generated results are evaluated in terms of content preservation, plausibility, and diversity. Comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to validate our network designs.

    * Abstract: Modern online multiple object tracking (MOT) methods usually focus on two directions to improve tracking performance. One is to predict new positions in an incoming frame based on tracking information from previous frames, and the other is to enhance data association by generating more discriminative identity embeddings. Some works combined both directions within one framework but handled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual benefits. In this paper, we propose a novel unified model with synergy between position prediction and embedding association. The two tasks are linked by temporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as identity-aware memory aggregation model. Specifically, the attention modules can make the prediction focus more on targets and less on distractors, therefore more reliable embeddings can be extracted accordingly for association. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost identity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention modules and suppress drifts. In this way, the synergy between position prediction and embedding association is achieved, which leads to strong robustness to occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over a wide range of existing methods on MOTChallenge benchmarks.

    * Abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims at learning to localize objects of interest by only using the image-level labels as the supervision. While numerous efforts have been made in this field, recent approaches still suffer from two challenges: one is the part domination issue while the other is the learning robustness issue. Specifically, the former makes the localizer prone to the local discriminative object regions rather than the desired whole object, and the latter makes the localizer over-sensitive to the variations of the input images so that one can hardly obtain localization results robust to the arbitrary visual stimulus. To solve these issues, we propose a novel framework to strengthen the learning tolerance, referred to as SLT-Net, for WSOL. Specifically, we consider two-fold learning tolerance strengthening mechanisms. One is the semantic tolerance strengthening mechanism, which allows the localizer to make mistakes for classifying similar semantics so that it will not concentrate too much on the discriminative local regions. The other is the visual stimuli tolerance strengthening mechanism, which enforces the localizer to be robust to different image transformations so that the prediction quality will not be sensitive to each specific input image. Finally, we implement comprehensive experimental comparisons on two widely-used datasets CUB and ILSVRC2012, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

    * Abstract: Visual Place Recognition is a challenging task for robotics and autonomous systems, which must deal with the twin problems of appearance and viewpoint change in an always changing world. This paper introduces Patch-NetVLAD, which provides a novel formulation for combining the advantages of both local and global descriptor methods by deriving patch-level features from NetVLAD residuals. Unlike the fixed spatial neighborhood regime of existing local keypoint features, our method enables aggregation and matching of deep-learned local features defined over the feature-space grid. We further introduce a multi-scale fusion of patch features that have complementary scales (i.e. patch sizes) via an integral feature space and show that the fused features are highly invariant to both condition (season, structure, and illumination) and viewpoint (translation and rotation) changes. Patch-NetVLAD achieves state-of-the-art visual place recognition results in computationally limited scenarios, validated on a range of challenging real-world datasets, including winning the Facebook Mapillary Visual Place Recognition Challenge at ECCV2020. It is also adaptable to user requirements, with a speed-optimised version operating over an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. By combining superior performance with improved computational efficiency in a configurable framework, Patch-NetVLAD is well suited to enhance both stand-alone place recognition capabilities and the overall performance of SLAM systems.

    * Abstract: Recent advances in OCR have shown that an end-to-end (E2E) training pipeline that includes both detection and recognition leads to the best results. However, many existing methods focus primarily on Latin-alphabet languages, often even only case-insensitive English characters. In this paper, we propose an E2E approach, Multiplexed Multilingual Mask TextSpotter, that performs script identification at the word level and handles different scripts with different recognition heads, all while maintaining a unified loss that simultaneously optimizes script identification and multiple recognition heads. Experiments show that our method outperforms single-head model with similar parameters in end-to-end recognition tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results on MLT17 and MLT19 joint text detection and script identification benchmarks. We believe that our work is a step towards end-to-end trainable and scalable multilingual multi-purpose OCR system.

    * Abstract: Extracting detailed 3D information of objects from video data is an important goal for holistic scene understanding. While recent methods have shown impressive results when reconstructing meshes of objects from a single image, results often remain ambiguous as part of the object is unobserved. Moreover, existing image-based datasets for mesh reconstruction don't permit to study models which integrate temporal information. To alleviate both concerns we present SAIL-VOS 3D: a synthetic video dataset with frame-by-frame mesh annotations which extends SAIL-VOS. We also develop first baselines for reconstruction of 3D meshes from video data via temporal models. We demonstrate efficacy of the proposed baseline on SAIL-VOS 3D and Pix3D, showing that temporal information improves reconstruction quality.

    * Abstract: A novel algorithm to detect an optimal set of semantic lines is proposed in this work. We develop two networks: selection network (S-Net) and harmonization network (H-Net). First, S-Net computes the probabilities and offsets of line candidates. Second, we filter out irrelevant lines through a selection-and-removal process. Third, we construct a complete graph, whose edge weights are computed by H-Net. Finally, we determine a maximal weight clique representing an optimal set of semantic lines. Moreover, to assess the overall harmony of detected lines, we propose a novel metric, called HIoU. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can detect harmonious semantic lines effectively and efficiently.

    * Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) models are the standard way 3D shapes are described in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) applications. They combine lightweight parametric curves and surfaces with topological information which connects the geometric entities to describe manifolds. In this paper we introduce BRepNet, a neural network architecture designed to operate directly on B-rep data structures, avoiding the need to approximate the model as meshes or point clouds. BRepNet defines convolutional kernels with respect to oriented coedges in the data structure. In the neighborhood of each coedge, a small collection of faces, edges and coedges can be identified and patterns in the feature vectors from these entities detected by specific learnable parameters. In addition, to encourage further deep learning research with B-reps, we publish the Fusion 360 Gallery segmentation dataset. A collection of over 35,000 B-rep models annotated with information about the modeling operations which created each face. We demonstrate that BRepNet can segment these models with higher accuracy than methods working on meshes, and point clouds.

    * Abstract: We propose DeepMetaHandles, a 3D conditional generative model based on mesh deformation. Given a collection of 3D meshes of a category and their deformation handles (control points), our method learns a set of meta-handles for each shape, which are represented as combinations of the given handles. The disentangled meta-handles factorize all the plausible deformations of the shape, while each of them corresponds to an intuitive deformation. A new deformation can then be generated by sampling the coefficients of the meta-handles in a specific range. We employ biharmonic coordinates as the deformation function, which can smoothly propagate the control points' translations to the entire mesh. To avoid learning zero deformation as meta-handles, we incorporate a target-fitting module which deforms the input mesh to match a random target. To enhance deformations' plausibility, we employ a soft-rasterizer-based discriminator that projects the meshes to a 2D space. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of the generated deformations as well as the interpretability and consistency of the learned meta-handles.

    * Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular, network-like structures, such as vessels, neurons, or roads, is relevant to many fields of research. For such structures, the topology is their most important characteristic; particularly preserving connectedness: in the case of vascular networks, missing a connected vessel entirely alters the blood-flow dynamics. We introduce a novel similarity measure termed centerlineDice (short clDice), which is calculated on the intersection of the segmentation masks and their (morphological) skeleta. We theoretically prove that clDice guarantees topology preservation up to homotopy equivalence for binary 2D and 3D segmentation. Extending this, we propose a computationally efficient, differentiable loss function (soft-clDice) for training arbitrary neural segmentation networks. We benchmark the soft-clDice loss on five public datasets, including vessels, roads and neurons (2D and 3D). Training on soft-clDice leads to segmentation with more accurate connectivity information, higher graph similarity, and better volumetric scores.

    * Abstract: The problem of grounding VQA tasks has seen an increased attention in the research community recently, with most attempts usually focusing on solving this task by using pretrained object detectors. However, pre-trained object detectors require bounding box annotations for detecting relevant objects in the vocabulary, which may not always be feasible for real-life large-scale applications. In this paper, we focus on a more relaxed setting: the grounding of relevant visual entities in a weakly supervised manner by training on the VQA task alone. To address this problem, we propose a visual capsule module with a query-based selection mechanism of capsule features, that allows the model to focus on relevant regions based on the textual cues about visual information in the question. We show that integrating the proposed capsule module in existing VQA systems significantly improves their performance on the weakly supervised grounding task. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two state-of-the-art VQA systems, stacked NMN and MAC, on the CLEVR-Answers benchmark, our new evaluation set based on CLEVR scenes with ground truth bounding boxes for objects that are relevant for the correct answer, as well as on GQA, a real world VQA dataset with compositional questions. We show that the systems with the proposed capsule module consistently outperform the respective baseline systems in terms of answer grounding, while achieving comparable performance on VQA task.

    * Authors: Shenzhi Wang, Liwei Wu, Lei Cui, Yujun Shen
    * Abstract: Anomaly localization, with the purpose to segment the anomalous regions within images, is challenging due to the large variety of anomaly types. Existing methods typically train deep models by treating the entire image as a whole yet put little effort into learning the local distribution, which is vital for this pixel-precise task. In this work, we propose an unsupervised patch-based approach that gives due consideration to both the global and local information. More concretely, we employ a Local-Net and Global-Net to extract features from any individual patch and its surrounding respectively. Global-Net is trained with the purpose to mimic the local feature such that we can easily detect an abnormal patch when its feature mismatches that from the context. We further introduce an Inconsistency Anomaly Detection (IAD) head and a Distortion Anomaly Detection (DAD) head to sufficiently spot the discrepancy between global and local features. A scoring function derived from the multi-head design facilitates high-precision anomaly localization. Extensive experiments on a couple of real-world datasets suggest that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors by a sufficiently large margin.

    * Authors: Qi Wan, Haoqin Ji, Linlin Shen
    * Abstract: Pre-trained models play an important role in deep learning based text detectors. However, most methods ignore the gap between natural images and scene text images and directly apply ImageNet for pre-training. To address such a problem, some of them firstly pre-train the model using a large amount of synthetic data and then fine-tune it on target datasets, which is task-specific and has limited generalization capability. In this paper, we focus on providing general pre-trained models for text detectors. Considering the importance of exploring text contents for text detection, we propose STKM (Self-attention based Text Knowledge Mining), which consists of a CNN Encoder and a Self-attention Decoder, to learn general prior knowledge for text detection from SynthText. Given only image level text labels, Self-attention Decoder directly decodes features extracted from CNN Encoder to texts without requirement of detection, which guides the CNN backbone to explicitly learn discriminative semantic representations ignored by previous approaches. After that, the text knowledge learned by the backbone can be transferred to various text detectors to significantly improve their detection performance (e.g., 5.89% higher F-measure for EAST on ICDAR15 dataset) without bells and whistles.

    * Abstract: In computer-aided design (CAD), the ability to "reverse engineer" the modeling steps used to create 3D shapes is a long-sought-after goal. This process can be decomposed into two sub-problems: converting an input mesh or point cloud into a boundary representation (or B-rep), and then inferring modeling operations which construct this B-rep. In this paper, we present a new system for solving the second sub-problem. Central to our approach is a new geometric representation: the zone graph. Zones are the set of solid regions formed by extending all B-Rep faces and partitioning space with them; a zone graph has these zones as its nodes, with edges denoting geometric adjacencies between them. Zone graphs allow us to tractably work with industry-standard CAD operations, unlike prior work using CSG with parametric primitives. We focus on CAD programs consisting of sketch + extrude + Boolean operations, which are common in CAD practice. We phrase our problem as search in the space of such extrusions permitted by the zone graph, and we train a graph neural network to score potential extrusions in order to accelerate the search. We show that our approach outperforms an existing CSG inference baseline in terms of geometric reconstruction accuracy and reconstruction time, while also creating more plausible modeling sequences.

    * Authors: Gengshan Yang, Deva Ramanan
    * Abstract: Appearance-based detectors achieve remarkable performance on common scenes, benefiting from high-capacity models and massive annotated data, but tend to fail for scenarios that lack training data. Geometric motion segmentation algorithms, however, generalize to novel scenes, but have yet to achieve comparable performance to appearance-based ones, due to noisy motion estimations and degenerate motion configurations. To combine the best of both worlds, we propose a modular network, whose architecture is motivated by a geometric analysis of what independent object motions can be recovered from an ego-motion field. It takes two consecutive frames as input and predicts segmentation masks for the background and multiple rigidly moving objects, which are then parameterized by 3D rigid transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for rigid motion segmentation on KITTI and Sintel. The inferred rigid motions lead to a significant improvement for depth and scene flow estimation.

    * Abstract: This paper provides a review of the NTIRE 2021 challenge targeting defocus deblurring using dual-pixel (DP) data. The goal of this single-track challenge was to reduce spatially varying defocus blur present in images captured with a shallow depth of field. The images used in this challenge were obtained using a DP sensor that provided a pair of DP views per captured image. Submitted solutions were evaluated using conventional signal processing metrics, namely peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Out of 185 registered participants, nine teams provided methods and competed in the final stage. The paper describes the methods proposed by the participating teams and their results. The winning teams represent the state-of-the-art in terms of defocus deblurring using DP images.

    * Abstract: We tackle the problem of learning object detectors without supervision. Differently from weakly-supervised object detection, we do not assume image-level class labels. Instead, we extract a supervisory signal from audio-visual data, using the audio component to "teach" the object detector. While this problem is related to sound source localisation, it is considerably harder because the detector must classify the objects by type, enumerate each instance of the object, and do so even when the object is silent. We tackle this problem by first designing a self-supervised framework with a contrastive objective that jointly learns to classify and localise objects. Then, without using any supervision, we simply use these self-supervised labels and boxes to train an image-based object detector. With this, we outperform previous unsupervised and weakly-supervised detectors for the task of object detection and sound source localization. We also show that we can align this detector to ground-truth classes with as little as one label per pseudo-class, and show how our method can learn to detect generic objects that go beyond instruments, such as airplanes and cats.

    * Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework that generalizes simple and fast algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with both attractive and repulsive interactions between the nodes. This framework defines GASP, a Generalized Algorithm for Signed graph Partitioning, and allows us to explore many combinations of different linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints. We prove the equivalence of existing clustering methods to some of those combinations and introduce new algorithms for combinations that have not been studied before. We study both theoretical and empirical properties of these combinations and prove that some of these define an ultrametric on the graph. We conduct a systematic comparison of various instantiations of GASP on a large variety of both synthetic and existing signed clustering problems, in terms of accuracy but also efficiency and robustness to noise. Lastly, we show that some of the algorithms included in our framework, when combined with the predictions from a CNN model, result in a simple bottom-up instance segmentation pipeline. Going all the way from pixels to final segments with a simple procedure, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the CREMI 2016 EM segmentation benchmark without requiring domain-specific superpixels.

    * Authors: Wentao Bao, Qi Yu, Yu Kong
    * Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has experienced remarkable success under the supervised learning paradigm. However, existing TAL methods are rooted in the closed set assumption, which cannot handle the inevitable unknown actions in open-world scenarios. In this paper, we, for the first time, step toward the Open Set TAL (OSTAL) problem and propose a general framework OpenTAL based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). Specifically, the OpenTAL consists of uncertainty-aware action classification, actionness prediction, and temporal location regression. With the proposed importance-balanced EDL method, classification uncertainty is learned by collecting categorical evidence majorly from important samples. To distinguish the unknown actions from background video frames, the actionness is learned by the positive-unlabeled learning. The classification uncertainty is further calibrated by leveraging the guidance from the temporal localization quality. The OpenTAL is general to enable existing TAL models for open set scenarios, and experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method. The code and pre-trained models are released at https://www.rit.edu/actionlab/opental.

    * Abstract: Traditional marker-based motion capture requires excessive and specialized equipment, hindering accessibility and wider adoption. In this work, we demonstrate such a system but rely on a very sparse set of low-cost consumer-grade sensors. Our system exploits a data-driven backend to infer the captured subject's joint positions from noisy marker estimates in real-time. In addition to reduced costs and portability, its inherent denoising nature allows for quicker captures by alleviating the need for precise marker placement and post-processing, making it suitable for interactive virtual reality applications.

    * Abstract: Many recent works in dentistry and maxillofacial imagery focused on the Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) canal detection. Unfortunately, the small extent of available 3D maxillofacial datasets has strongly limited the performance of deep learning-based techniques. On the other hand, a huge amount of sparsely annotated data is produced every day from the regular procedures in the maxillofacial practice. Despite the amount of sparsely labeled images being significant, the adoption of those data still raises an open problem. Indeed, the deep learning approach frames the presence of dense annotations as a crucial factor. Recent efforts in literature have hence focused on developing label propagation techniques to expand sparse annotations into dense labels.However, the proposed methods proved only marginally effective for the purpose of segmenting the alveolar nerve in CBCT scans.This paper exploits and publicly releases a new 3D densely annotated dataset, through which we are able to train a deep label propagation model which obtains better results than those available in literature. By combining a segmentation model trained on the 3D annotated data and label propagation, we significantly improve the state of the art in the Inferior Alveolar Nerve segmentation.

    * Abstract: The semantic segmentation of nighttime scenes is a challenging problem that is key to impactful applications like self-driving cars. Yet, it has received little attention compared to its daytime counterpart. In this paper, we propose NightLab, a novel nighttime segmentation framework that leverages multiple deep learning models imbued with night-aware features to yield State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on multiple night segmentation benchmarks. Notably, NightLab contains models at two levels of granularity, i.e. image and regional, and each level is composed of light adaptation and segmentation modules. Given a nighttime image, the image level model provides an initial segmentation estimate while, in parallel, a hardness detection module identifies regions and their surrounding context that need further analysis. A regional level model focuses on these difficult regions to provide a significantly improved segmentation. All the models in NightLab are trained end-to-end using a set of proposed night-aware losses without handcrafted heuristics. Extensive experiments on the NightCity and BDD100K datasets show NightLab achieves SoTA performance compared to concurrent methods. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/xdeng7/NightLab.

    * Abstract: The availability of large-scale video action understanding datasets has facilitated advances in the interpretation of visual scenes containing people. However, learning to recognise human actions and their social interactions in an unconstrained real-world environment comprising numerous people, with potentially highly unbalanced and long-tailed distributed action labels from a stream of sensory data captured from a mobile robot platform remains a significant challenge, not least owing to the lack of a reflective large-scale dataset. In this paper, we introduce JRDB-Act, as an extension of the existing JRDB, which is captured by a social mobile manipulator and reflects a real distribution of human daily-life actions in a university campus environment. JRDB-Act has been densely annotated with atomic actions, comprises over 2.8M action labels, constituting a large-scale spatio-temporal action detection dataset. Each human bounding box is labeled with one pose-based action label and multiple (optional) interaction-based action labels. Moreover JRDB-Act provides social group annotation, conducive to the task of grouping individuals based on their interactions in the scene to infer their social activities (common activities in each social group). Each annotated label in JRDB-Act is tagged with the annotators' confidence level which contributes to the development of reliable evaluation strategies. In order to demonstrate how one can effectively utilise such annotations, we develop an end-to-end trainable pipeline to learn and infer these tasks, i.e. individual action and social group detection. The data and the evaluation code will be publicly available at https://jrdb.erc.monash.edu/.

    * Abstract: Relative pose estimation using the 5-point or 7-point Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithms can fail even when no outliers are present and there are enough inliers to support a hypothesis. These cases arise due to numerical instability of the 5- and 7-point minimal problems. This paper characterizes these instabilities, both in terms of minimal world scene configurations that lead to infinite condition number in epipolar estimation, and also in terms of the related minimal image feature pair correspondence configurations. The instability is studied in the context of a novel framework for analyzing the conditioning of minimal problems in multiview geometry, based on Riemannian manifolds. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data reveal that RANSAC does not only serve to filter out outliers, but RANSAC also selects for well-conditioned image data, sufficiently separated from the ill-posed locus that our theory predicts. These findings suggest that, in future work, one could try to accelerate and increase the success of RANSAC by testing only well-conditioned image data.

We pair traditional stereopsis and modern differentiable rendering to build an end-to-end model which predicts textured 3D meshes of objects with varying topologies and shape. We frame stereopsis as an optimization problem and simultaneously update shape and cameras via simple gradient descent. We run an extensive quantitative analysis and compare to traditional multi-view stereo techniques and state-of-the-art learning based methods. We show compelling reconstructions on challenging real-world scenes and for an abundance of object types with complex shape, topology and texture.

    * Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have relied on large, labelled datasets to train high-capacity models. However, collecting large datasets in a time- and cost-efficient manner often results in label noise. We present a method for learning from noisy labels that leverages similarities between training examples in feature space, encouraging the prediction of each example to be similar to its nearest neighbours. Compared to training algorithms that use multiple models or distinct stages, our approach takes the form of a simple, additional regularization term. It can be interpreted as an inductive version of the classical, transductive label propagation algorithm. We thoroughly evaluate our method on datasets evaluating both synthetic (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and realistic (mini-WebVision, WebVision, Clothing1M, mini-ImageNet-Red) noise, and achieve competitive or state-of-the-art accuracies across all of them.

    * Abstract: E-commerce images are playing a central role in attracting people's attention when retailing and shopping online, and an accurate attention prediction is of significant importance for both customers and retailers, where its research is yet to start. In this paper, we establish the first dataset of saliency e-commerce images (SalECI), which allows for learning to predict saliency on the e-commerce images. We then provide specialized and thorough analysis by highlighting the distinct features of e-commerce images, e.g., non-locality and correlation to text regions. Correspondingly, taking advantages of the non-local and self-attention mechanisms, we propose a salient SWin-Transformer backbone, followed by a multi-task learning with saliency and text detection heads, where an information flow mechanism is proposed to further benefit both tasks. Experimental results have verified the state-of-the-art performances of our work in the e-commerce scenario.

    * Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the anatomic skeleton of a person, in an arbitrary pose, from the 3D surface of the body; i.e. we predict the inside (bones) from the outside (skin). This has many applications in medicine and biomechanics. Existing state-of-the-art biomechanical skeletons are detailed but do not easily generalize to new subjects. Additionally, computer vision and graphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned from data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated against ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D body surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male and 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit a parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel part-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside training pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA in a pose-normalized space and train a regressor from body shape parameters to skeleton shape parameters. Given an arbitrary 3D body shape and pose, OSSO predicts a realistic skeleton inside. In contrast to previous work, we evaluate the accuracy of the skeleton shape quantitatively on held out DXA scans, outperforming the state-of-the art. We also show 3D skeleton prediction from varied and challenging 3D bodies. The code to infer a skeleton from a body shape is available at https://osso.is.tue.mpg.de, and the dataset of paired outer surface (skin) and skeleton (bone) meshes is available as a Biobank Returned Dataset. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource.

    * Authors: Salar Hosseini Khorasgani, Yuxuan Chen, Florian Shkurti
    * Abstract: Self-supervised methods have significantly closed the gap with end-to-end supervised learning for image classification [13,24]. In the case of human action videos, however, where both appearance and motion are significant factors of variation, this gap remains significant [28,58]. One of the key reasons for this is that sampling pairs of similar video clips, a required step for many self-supervised contrastive learning methods, is currently done conservatively to avoid false positives. A typical assumption is that similar clips only occur temporally close within a single video, leading to insufficient examples of motion similarity. To mitigate this, we propose SLIC, a clustering-based self-supervised contrastive learning method for human action videos. Our key contribution is that we improve upon the traditional intra-video positive sampling by using iterative clustering to group similar video instances. This enables our method to leverage pseudo-labels from the cluster assignments to sample harder positives and negatives. SLIC outperforms state-of-the-art video retrieval baselines by +15.4% on top-1 recall on UCF101 and by +5.7% when directly transferred to HMDB51. With end-to-end finetuning for action classification, SLIC achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy (+0.8%) on UCF101 and 54.5% on HMDB51 (+1.6%). SLIC is also competitive with the state-of-the-art in action classification after self-supervised pretraining on Kinetics400.

    * Abstract: As deep neural networks become the state-of-the-art approach in the field of computer vision for dense prediction tasks, many methods have been developed for automatic estimation of the target outputs given the visual inputs. Although the estimation accuracy of the proposed automatic methods continues to improve, interactive refinement is oftentimes necessary for further correction. Recently, feature backpropagating refinement scheme (f-BRS) has been proposed for the task of interactive segmentation, which enables efficient optimization of a small set of auxiliary variables inserted into the pretrained network to produce object segmentation that better aligns with user inputs. However, the proposed auxiliary variables only contain channel-wise scale and bias, limiting the optimization to global refinement only. In this work, in order to generalize backpropagating refinement for a wide range of dense prediction tasks, we introduce a set of G-BRS (Generalized Backpropagating Refinement Scheme) layers that enable both global and localized refinement for the following tasks: interactive segmentation, semantic segmentation, image matting and monocular depth estimation. Experiments on SBD, Cityscapes, Mapillary Vista, Composition-1k and NYU-Depth-V2 show that our method can successfully generalize and significantly improve performance of existing pretrained state-of-the-art models with only a few clicks.

    * Abstract: Recently self-supervised representation learning has drawn considerable attention from the scene text recognition community. Different from previous studies using contrastive learning, we tackle the issue from an alternative perspective, i.e., by formulating the representation learning scheme in a generative manner. Typically, the neighboring image patches among one text line tend to have similar styles, including the strokes, textures, colors, etc. Motivated by this common sense, we augment one image patch and use its neighboring patch as guidance to recover itself. Specifically, we propose a Similarity-Aware Normalization (SimAN) module to identify the different patterns and align the corresponding styles from the guiding patch. In this way, the network gains representation capability for distinguishing complex patterns such as messy strokes and cluttered backgrounds. Experiments show that the proposed SimAN significantly improves the representation quality and achieves promising performance. Moreover, we surprisingly find that our self-supervised generative network has impressive potential for data synthesis, text image editing, and font interpolation, which suggests that the proposed SimAN has a wide range of practical applications.

    * Abstract: Image rasterization is a mature technique in computer graphics, while image vectorization, the reverse path of rasterization, remains a major challenge. Recent ad- vanced deep learning-based models achieve vectorization and semantic interpolation of vector graphs and demon- strate a better topology of generating new figures. How- ever, deep models cannot be easily generalized to out-of- domain testing data. The generated SVGs also contain complex and redundant shapes that are not quite conve- nient for further editing. Specifically, the crucial layer- wise topology and fundamental semantics in images are still not well understood and thus not fully explored. In this work, we propose Layer-wise Image Vectorization, namely LIVE, to convert raster images to SVGs and simultaneously maintain its image topology. LIVE can generate compact SVG forms with layer-wise structures that are semantically consistent with the human perspective. We progressively add new bezier paths and optimize these paths with the layer-wise framework, newly designed loss functions, and component-wise path initialization technique. Our experi- ments demonstrate that LIVE presents more plausible vec- torized forms than prior works and can be generalized to new images. With the help of this newly learned topol- ogy, LIVE initiates human editable SVGs for both design- ers and other downstream applications.

    * Abstract: Unsupervised localization and segmentation are long-standing computer vision challenges that involve decomposing an image into semantically-meaningful segments without any labeled data. These tasks are particularly interesting in an unsupervised setting due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining dense image annotations, but existing unsupervised approaches struggle with complex scenes containing multiple objects. Differently from existing methods, which are purely based on deep learning, we take inspiration from traditional spectral segmentation methods by reframing image decomposition as a graph partitioning problem. Specifically, we examine the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of a feature affinity matrix from self-supervised networks. We find that these eigenvectors already decompose an image into meaningful segments, and can be readily used to localize objects in a scene. Furthermore, by clustering the features associated with these segments across a dataset, we can obtain well-delineated, nameable regions, i.e. semantic segmentations. Experiments on complex datasets (Pascal VOC, MS-COCO) demonstrate that our simple spectral method outperforms the state-of-the-art in unsupervised localization and segmentation by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be readily used for a variety of complex image editing tasks, such as background removal and compositing.

    * Abstract: Recent techniques have been successful in reconstructing surfaces as level sets of learned functions (such as signed distance fields) parameterized by deep neural networks. Many of these methods, however, learn only closed surfaces and are unable to reconstruct shapes with boundary curves. We propose a hybrid shape representation that combines explicit boundary curves with implicit learned interiors. Using machinery from geometric measure theory, we parameterize currents using deep networks and use stochastic gradient descent to solve a minimal surface problem. By modifying the metric according to target geometry coming, e.g., from a mesh or point cloud, we can use this approach to represent arbitrary surfaces, learning implicitly defined shapes with explicitly defined boundary curves. We further demonstrate learning families of shapes jointly parameterized by boundary curves and latent codes.

    * Abstract: Novel-view prediction of a scene has many applications. Existing works mainly focus on generating novel-view images via pixel-wise prediction in the image space, often resulting in severe ghosting and blurry artifacts. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore novel-view prediction in the layout space, and introduce the new problem of novel-view scene layout generation. Given a single scene layout and the camera transformation as inputs, our goal is to generate a plausible scene layout for a specified viewpoint. Such a problem is challenging as it involves accurate understanding of the 3D geometry and semantics of the scene from as little as a single 2D scene layout. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a deep model to capture contextualized object representation by explicitly modeling the object context transformation in the scene. The contextualized object representation is essential in generating geometrically and semantically consistent scene layouts of different views. Experiments show that our model outperforms several strong baselines on many indoor and outdoor scenes, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that our model enables a wide range of applications, including novel-view image synthesis, novel-view image editing, and amodal object estimation.

    * Abstract: Reconstruction of geometric structures from images using supervised learning suffers from limited available amount of accurate data. One type of such data is accurate real-world RGB-D images. A major challenge in acquiring such ground truth data is the accurate alignment between RGB images and the point cloud measured by a depth scanner. To overcome this difficulty, we consider a differential optimization method that aligns a colored point cloud with a given color image through iterative geometric and color matching. In the proposed framework, the optimization minimizes the photometric difference between the colors of the point cloud and the corresponding colors of the image pixels. Unlike other methods that try to reduce this photometric error, we analyze the computation of the gradient on the image plane and propose a different direct scheme. We assume that the colors produced by the geometric scanner camera and the color camera sensor are different and therefore characterized by different chromatic acquisition properties. Under these multimodal conditions, we find the transformation between the camera image and the point cloud colors. We alternately optimize for aligning the position of the point cloud and matching the different color spaces. The alignments produced by the proposed method are demonstrated on both synthetic data with quantitative evaluation and real scenes with qualitative results.

    * Abstract: We discuss methods for visualizing neural network decision boundaries and decision regions. We use these visualizations to investigate issues related to reproducibility and generalization in neural network training. We observe that changes in model architecture (and its associate inductive bias) cause visible changes in decision boundaries, while multiple runs with the same architecture yield results with strong similarities, especially in the case of wide architectures. We also use decision boundary methods to visualize double descent phenomena. We see that decision boundary reproducibility depends strongly on model width. Near the threshold of interpolation, neural network decision boundaries become fragmented into many small decision regions, and these regions are non-reproducible. Meanwhile, very narrows and very wide networks have high levels of reproducibility in their decision boundaries with relatively few decision regions. We discuss how our observations relate to the theory of double descent phenomena in convex models. Code is available at https://github.com/somepago/dbViz.

    * Abstract: In computer-aided design (CAD) systems, 2D line drawings are commonly used to illustrate 3D object designs. To reconstruct the 3D models depicted by a single 2D line drawing, an important key is finding the edge loops in the line drawing which correspond to the actual faces of the 3D object. In this paper, we approach the classical problem of face identification from a novel data-driven point of view. We cast it as a sequence generation problem: starting from an arbitrary edge, we adopt a variant of the popular Transformer model to predict the edges associated with the same face in a natural order. This allows us to avoid searching the space of all possible edge loops with various hand-crafted rules and heuristics as most existing methods do, deal with challenging cases such as curved surfaces and nested edge loops, and leverage additional cues such as face types. We further discuss how possibly imperfect predictions can be used for 3D object reconstruction. The project page is at https://manycore-research.github.io/faceformer.

    * Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR), aiming to find spatial correspondence between images, is one of the most critical problems in the domain of medical image analysis. In this paper, we present a novel, generic, and accurate diffeomorphic image registration framework that utilizes neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). We model each voxel as a moving particle and consider the set of all voxels in a 3D image as a high-dimensional dynamical system whose trajectory determines the targeted deformation field. Our method leverages deep neural networks for their expressive power in modeling dynamical systems, and simultaneously optimizes for a dynamical system between the image pairs and the corresponding transformation. Our formulation allows various constraints to be imposed along the transformation to maintain desired regularities. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms the benchmarks under various metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility to expand our framework to register multiple image sets using a unified form of transformation, which could possibly serve a wider range of applications.

    * Abstract: Robustness and discrimination power are two fundamental requirements in visual object tracking. In most tracking paradigms, we find that the features extracted by the popular Siamese-like networks can not fully discriminatively model the tracked targets and distractor objects, hindering them from simultaneously meeting these two requirements. While most methods focus on designing robust matching operations, we propose a novel target-dependent feature network inspired by the self-/cross-attention scheme. In contrast to the Siamese-like feature extraction, our network deeply embeds cross-image feature correlation in multiple layers of the feature network. By extensively matching the features of the two images through multiple layers, it is able to suppress non-target features, resulting in instance-varying feature extraction. The output features of the search image can be directly used for predicting target locations without extra correlation step. Moreover, our model can be flexibly pre-trained on abundant unpaired images, leading to notably faster convergence than the existing methods. Extensive experiments show our method achieves the state-of-the-art results while running at real-time. Our feature networks also can be applied to existing tracking pipelines seamlessly to raise the tracking performance.

    * Abstract: Recent development of neural implicit function has shown tremendous success on high-quality 3D shape reconstruction. However, most works divide the space into inside and outside of the shape, which limits their representing power to single-layer and watertight shapes. This limitation leads to tedious data processing (converting non-watertight raw data to watertight) as well as the incapability of representing general object shapes in the real world. In this work, we propose a novel method to represent general shapes including non-watertight shapes and shapes with multi-layer surfaces. We introduce General Implicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS), which models the relationships between every two points instead of the relationships between points and surfaces. Instead of dividing 3D space into predefined inside-outside regions, GIFS encodes whether two points are separated by any surface. Experiments on ShapeNet show that GIFS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality, rendering efficiency, and visual fidelity.

    * Abstract: Curating a large set of fully annotated training data can be costly, especially for the tasks of medical image segmentation. Scribble, a weaker form of annotation, is more obtainable in practice, but training segmentation models from limited supervision of scribbles is still challenging. To address the difficulties, we propose a new framework for scribble learning-based medical image segmentation, which is composed of mix augmentation and cycle consistency and thus is referred to as CycleMix. For augmentation of supervision, CycleMix adopts the mixup strategy with a dedicated design of random occlusion, to perform increments and decrements of scribbles. For regularization of supervision, CycleMix intensifies the training objective with consistency losses to penalize inconsistent segmentation, which results in significant improvement of segmentation performance. Results on two open datasets, i.e., ACDC and MSCMRseg, showed that the proposed method achieved exhilarating performance, demonstrating comparable or even better accuracy than the fully-supervised methods. The code and expert-made scribble annotations for MSCMRseg are publicly available at https://github.com/BWGZK/CycleMIx.

    * Abstract: Spotting graphical symbols from the computer-aided design (CAD) drawings is essential to many industrial applications. Different from raster images, CAD drawings are vector graphics consisting of geometric primitives such as segments, arcs, and circles. By treating each CAD drawing as a graph, we propose a novel graph attention network GAT-CADNet to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem: vertex features derived from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to instance prediction. Our key contributions are three-fold: 1) the instance symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relation among vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encoding (CEE) module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is intuitive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem in one consolidated network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the public benchmark show that our graph-based approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

    * Abstract: Progress in self-supervised learning has brought strong general image representation learning methods. Yet so far, it has mostly focused on image-level learning. In turn, tasks such as unsupervised image segmentation have not benefited from this trend as they require spatially-diverse representations. However, learning dense representations is challenging, as in the unsupervised context it is not clear how to guide the model to learn representations that correspond to various potential object categories. In this paper, we argue that self-supervised learning of object parts is a solution to this issue. Object parts are generalizable: they are a priori independent of an object definition, but can be grouped to form objects a posteriori. To this end, we leverage the recently proposed Vision Transformer's capability of attending to objects and combine it with a spatially dense clustering task for fine-tuning the spatial tokens. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on three semantic segmentation benchmarks by 17%-3%, showing that our representations are versatile under various object definitions. Finally, we extend this to fully unsupervised segmentation - which refrains completely from using label information even at test-time - and demonstrate that a simple method for automatically merging discovered object parts based on community detection yields substantial gains.

    * Abstract: Making sense of large volumes of biological imaging data without human annotation often relies on unsupervised representation learning. Although efforts have been made to representing cropped-out microscopy images of single cells and single molecules, a more robust and general model that effectively maps every voxel in a whole cell volume onto a latent space is still lacking. Here, we use variational auto-encoder and metric learning to obtain a voxel-level representation, and explore using it for unsupervised segmentation. To our knowledge we are the first to present self-supervised voxel-level representation and subsequent unsupervised segmentation results for a complete cell. We improve upon earlier work by proposing an innovative approach to separate latent space into a semantic subspace and a transformational subspace, and only use the semantic representation for segmentation. We show that in the learned semantic representation the major subcellular components are visually distinguishable and the semantic subspace is more transformation-invariant than another sample latent subspace of equal dimension. For unsupervised segmentation we found that our model manages to automatically rediscover and separate the major classes with errors demonstrating spatial patterns, and further dissect the class not specified by reference segmentation into areas with consistent textures. Our segmentation outperforms a baseline by a large margin.

    * Abstract: Trajectory estimation is a fundamental component of racket sport analytics, as the trajectory contains information not only about the winning and losing of each point, but also how it was won or lost. In sports such as badminton, players benefit from knowing the full 3D trajectory, as the height of shuttlecock or ball provides valuable tactical information. Unfortunately, 3D reconstruction is a notoriously hard problem, and standard trajectory estimators can only track 2D pixel coordinates. In this work, we present the first complete end-to-end system for the extraction and segmentation of 3D shuttle trajectories from monocular badminton videos. Our system integrates badminton domain knowledge such as court dimension, shot placement, physical laws of motion, along with vision-based features such as player poses and shuttle tracking. We find that significant engineering efforts and model improvements are needed to make the overall system robust, and as a by-product of our work, improve state-of-the-art results on court recognition, 2D trajectory estimation, and hit recognition.

    * Abstract: We propose the use of fractals as mean of efficient data augmentation. Specifically, we employ plasma fractals as a means of adapting global image augmentation transformations into continuous local transforms. We formulate the diamond square algorithm as a cascade of simple convolution operations allowing efficient computation of plasma fractals on the GPU. We present the TorMentor image augmentation framework that is totally modular and deterministic across images and point-clouds. All image augmentation operations can be combined through pipelining and random branching to form flow networks of arbitrary width and depth. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach with experiments on document image segmentation (binarization) with the DIBCO datasets. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance to traditional image augmentation techniques. Finally, we use extended synthetic binary text images in a self-supervision regiment and outperform the same model when trained with limited data and simple extensions.

    * Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods have been proven relevant for visual similarity learning. However, they sometimes lack generalization properties because they are trained often using an inappropriate sample selection strategy or due to the difficulty of the dataset caused by a distributional shift in the data. These represent a significant drawback when attempting to learn the underlying data manifold. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop better ways of obtaining generalization and representation of the underlying manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to DML that we call Guided Deep Metric Learning, a novel architecture oriented to learning more compact clusters, improving generalization under distributional shifts in DML. This novel architecture consists of two independent models: A multi-branch master model, inspired from a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) perspective, generates a reduced hypothesis space based on prior knowledge from labeled data, which guides or regularizes the decision boundary of a student model during training under an offline knowledge distillation scheme. Experiments have shown that the proposed method is capable of a better manifold generalization and representation to up to 40% improvement (Recall@1, CIFAR10), using guidelines suggested by Musgrave et al. to perform a more fair and realistic comparison, which is currently absent in the literature.

    * Abstract: Yield forecasting has been a central task in computational agriculture because of its impact on agricultural management from the individual farmer to the government level. With advances in remote sensing technology, computational processing power, and machine learning, the ability to forecast yield has improved substantially over the past years. However, most previous work has been done leveraging low-resolution satellite imagery and forecasting yield at the region, county, or occasionally farm-level. In this work, we use high-resolution aerial imagery and output from high-precision harvesters to predict in-field harvest values for corn-raising farms in the US Midwest. By using the harvester information, we are able to cast the problem of yield-forecasting as a density estimation problem and predict a harvest rate, in bushels/acre, at every pixel in the field image. This approach provides the farmer with a detailed view of which areas of the farm may be performing poorly so he can make the appropriate management decisions in addition to providing an improved prediction of total yield. We evaluate both traditional machine learning approaches with hand-crafted features alongside deep learning methods. We demonstrate the superiority of our pixel-level approach based on an encoder-decoder framework which produces a 5.41% MAPE at the field-level.

    * Abstract: In digital pathology, the spatial context of cells is important for cell classification, cancer diagnosis and prognosis. To model such complex cell context, however, is challenging. Cells form different mixtures, lineages, clusters and holes. To model such structural patterns in a learnable fashion, we introduce several mathematical tools from spatial statistics and topological data analysis. We incorporate such structural descriptors into a deep generative model as both conditional inputs and a differentiable loss. This way, we are able to generate high quality multi-class cell layouts for the first time. We show that the topology-rich cell layouts can be used for data augmentation and improve the performance of downstream tasks such as cell classification.

    * Abstract: In semi-supervised medical image segmentation, there exist empirical mismatch problems between labeled and unlabeled data distribution. The knowledge learned from the labeled data may be largely discarded if treating labeled and unlabeled data separately or training labeled and unlabeled data in an inconsistent manner. We propose a straightforward method for alleviating the problem -- copy-pasting labeled and unlabeled data bidirectionally, in a simple Mean Teacher architecture. The method encourages unlabeled data to learn comprehensive common semantics from the labeled data in both inward and outward directions. More importantly, the consistent learning procedure for labeled and unlabeled data can largely reduce the empirical distribution gap. In detail, we copy-paste a random crop from a labeled image (foreground) onto an unlabeled image (background) and an unlabeled image (foreground) onto a labeled image (background), respectively. The two mixed images are fed into a Student network. It is trained by the generated supervisory signal via bidirectional copy-pasting between the predictions of the unlabeled images from the Teacher and the label maps of the labeled images. We explore several design choices of how to copy-paste to make it more effective for minimizing empirical distribution gaps between labeled and unlabeled data. We reveal that the simple mechanism of copy-pasting bidirectionally between labeled and unlabeled data is good enough and the experiments show solid gains (e.g., over 21% Dice improvement on ACDC dataset with 5% labeled data) compared with other state-of-the-arts on various semi-supervised medical image segmentation datasets.

Our anime-style domain poses unique challenges to single-view reconstruction; compared to natural images of human heads, character portrait illustrations have hair and accessories with more complex and diverse geometry, and are shaded with non-photorealistic contour lines. In addition, there is a lack of both 3D model and portrait illustration data suitable to train and evaluate this ambiguous stylized reconstruction task. Facing these challenges, our proposed PAniC-3D architecture crosses the illustration-to-3D domain gap with a line-filling model, and represents sophisticated geometries with a volumetric radiance field. We train our system with two large new datasets (11.2k Vroid 3D models, 1k Vtuber portrait illustrations), and evaluate on a novel AnimeRecon benchmark of illustration-to-3D pairs. PAniC-3D significantly outperforms baseline methods, and provides data to establish the task of stylized reconstruction from portrait illustrations.

    * Abstract: Structural pruning enables model acceleration by removing structurally-grouped parameters from neural networks. However, the parameter-grouping patterns vary widely across different models, making architecture-specific pruners, which rely on manually-designed grouping schemes, non-generalizable to new architectures. In this work, we study a highly-challenging yet barely-explored task, any structural pruning, to tackle general structural pruning of arbitrary architecture like CNNs, RNNs, GNNs and Transformers. The most prominent obstacle towards this goal lies in the structural coupling, which not only forces different layers to be pruned simultaneously, but also expects all removed parameters to be consistently unimportant, thereby avoiding structural issues and significant performance degradation after pruning. To address this problem, we propose a general and fully automatic method, Dependency Graph (DepGraph), to explicitly model the dependency between layers and comprehensively group coupled parameters for pruning. In this work, we extensively evaluate our method on several architectures and tasks, including ResNe(X)t, DenseNet, MobileNet and Vision transformer for images, GAT for graph, DGCNN for 3D point cloud, alongside LSTM for language, and demonstrate that, even with a simple norm-based criterion, the proposed method consistently yields gratifying performances.

    * Abstract: We propose a method for in-hand 3D scanning of an unknown object with a monocular camera. Our method relies on a neural implicit surface representation that captures both the geometry and the appearance of the object, however, by contrast with most NeRF-based methods, we do not assume that the camera-object relative poses are known. Instead, we simultaneously optimize both the object shape and the pose trajectory. As direct optimization over all shape and pose parameters is prone to fail without coarse-level initialization, we propose an incremental approach that starts by splitting the sequence into carefully selected overlapping segments within which the optimization is likely to succeed. We reconstruct the object shape and track its poses independently within each segment, then merge all the segments before performing a global optimization. We show that our method is able to reconstruct the shape and color of both textured and challenging texture-less objects, outperforms classical methods that rely only on appearance features, and that its performance is close to recent methods that assume known camera poses.

    * Abstract: Modern displays and contents support more than 8bits image and video. However, bit-starving situations such as compression codecs make low bit-depth (LBD) images (<8bits), occurring banding and blurry artifacts. Previous bit depth expansion (BDE) methods still produce unsatisfactory high bit-depth (HBD) images. To this end, we propose an implicit neural function with a bit query to recover de-quantized images from arbitrarily quantized inputs. We develop a phasor estimator to exploit the information of the nearest pixels. Our method shows superior performance against prior BDE methods on natural and animation images. We also demonstrate our model on YouTube UGC datasets for de-banding. Our source code is available at https://github.com/WooKyoungHan/ABCD

    * Authors: Ju He, Jieneng Chen, Ming-Xian Lin, Qihang Yu, Alan L. Yuille
    * Abstract: In this work, we present a robust approach for joint part and object segmentation. Specifically, we reformulate object and part segmentation as an optimization problem and build a hierarchical feature representation including pixel, part, and object-level embeddings to solve it in a bottom-up clustering manner. Pixels are grouped into several clusters where the part-level embeddings serve as cluster centers. Afterwards, object masks are obtained by compositing the part proposals. This bottom-up interaction is shown to be effective in integrating information from lower semantic levels to higher semantic levels. Based on that, our novel approach Compositor produces part and object segmentation masks simultaneously while improving the mask quality. Compositor achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartImageNet and Pascal-Part by outperforming previous methods by around 0.9% and 1.3% on PartImageNet, 0.4% and 1.7% on Pascal-Part in terms of part and object mIoU and demonstrates better robustness against occlusion by around 4.4% and 7.1% on part and object respectively.

    * Abstract: Supervised keypoint localization methods rely on large manually labeled image datasets, where objects can deform, articulate, or occlude. However, creating such large keypoint labels is time-consuming and costly, and is often error-prone due to inconsistent labeling. Thus, we desire an approach that can learn keypoint localization with fewer yet consistently annotated images. To this end, we present a novel formulation that learns to localize semantically consistent keypoint definitions, even for occluded regions, for varying object categories. We use a few user-labeled 2D images as input examples, which are extended via self-supervision using a larger unlabeled dataset. Unlike unsupervised methods, the few-shot images act as semantic shape constraints for object localization. Furthermore, we introduce 3D geometry-aware constraints to uplift keypoints, achieving more accurate 2D localization. Our general-purpose formulation paves the way for semantically conditioned generative modeling and attains competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy on several datasets, including human faces, eyes, animals, cars, and never-before-seen mouth interior (teeth) localization tasks, not attempted by the previous few-shot methods.

    * Abstract: Sequence generation models have recently made significant progress in unifying various vision tasks. Although some auto-regressive models have demonstrated promising results in end-to-end text spotting, they use specific detection formats while ignoring various text shapes and are limited in the maximum number of text instances that can be detected. To overcome these limitations, we propose a UNIfied scene Text Spotter, called UNITS. Our model unifies various detection formats, including quadrilaterals and polygons, allowing it to detect text in arbitrary shapes. Additionally, we apply starting-point prompting to enable the model to extract texts from an arbitrary starting point, thereby extracting more texts beyond the number of instances it was trained on. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis shows that UNITS can extract a larger number of texts than it was trained on. We provide the code for our method at https://github.com/clovaai/units.

    * Abstract: Humans excel at acquiring knowledge through observation. For example, we can learn to use new tools by watching demonstrations. This skill is fundamental for intelligent systems to interact with the world. A key step to acquire this skill is to identify what part of the object affords each action, which is called affordance grounding. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a framework called LOCATE that can identify matching object parts across images, to transfer knowledge from images where an object is being used (exocentric images used for learning), to images where the object is inactive (egocentric ones used to test). To this end, we first find interaction areas and extract their feature embeddings. Then we learn to aggregate the embeddings into compact prototypes (human, object part, and background), and select the one representing the object part. Finally, we use the selected prototype to guide affordance grounding. We do this in a weakly supervised manner, learning only from image-level affordance and object labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both seen and unseen objects.

    * Authors: Wei Lin, Antoni B. Chan
    * Abstract: The accuracy of crowd counting in images has improved greatly in recent years due to the development of deep neural networks for predicting crowd density maps. However, most methods do not further explore the ability to localize people in the density map, with those few works adopting simple methods, like finding the local peaks in the density map. In this paper, we propose the optimal transport minimization (OT-M) algorithm for crowd localization with density maps. The objective of OT-M is to find a target point map that has the minimal Sinkhorn distance with the input density map, and we propose an iterative algorithm to compute the solution. We then apply OT-M to generate hard pseudo-labels (point maps) for semi-supervised counting, rather than the soft pseudo-labels (density maps) used in previous methods. Our hard pseudo-labels provide stronger supervision, and also enable the use of recent density-to-point loss functions for training. We also propose a confidence weighting strategy to give higher weight to the more reliable unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve outstanding performance on both crowd localization and semi-supervised counting. Code is available at https://github.com/Elin24/OT-M.

    * Authors: Shaohui Liu, Yifan Yu, Rémi Pautrat, Marc Pollefeys, Viktor Larsson
    * Abstract: In contrast to sparse keypoints, a handful of line segments can concisely encode the high-level scene layout, as they often delineate the main structural elements. In addition to offering strong geometric cues, they are also omnipresent in urban landscapes and indoor scenes. Despite their apparent advantages, current line-based reconstruction methods are far behind their point-based counterparts. In this paper we aim to close the gap by introducing LIMAP, a library for 3D line mapping that robustly and efficiently creates 3D line maps from multi-view imagery. This is achieved through revisiting the degeneracy problem of line triangulation, carefully crafted scoring and track building, and exploiting structural priors such as line coincidence, parallelism, and orthogonality. Our code integrates seamlessly with existing point-based Structure-from-Motion methods and can leverage their 3D points to further improve the line reconstruction. Furthermore, as a byproduct, the method is able to recover 3D association graphs between lines and points / vanishing points (VPs). In thorough experiments, we show that LIMAP significantly outperforms existing approaches for 3D line mapping. Our robust 3D line maps also open up new research directions. We show two example applications: visual localization and bundle adjustment, where integrating lines alongside points yields the best results. Code is available at https://github.com/cvg/limap.

    * Abstract: Neuron reconstruction in a full adult fly brain from high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) data is regarded as a cornerstone for neuroscientists to explore how neurons inspire intelligence. As the central part of neurons, somas in the full brain indicate the origin of neurogenesis and neural functions. However, due to the absence of EM datasets specifically annotated for somas, existing deep learning-based neuron reconstruction methods cannot directly provide accurate soma distribution and morphology. Moreover, full brain neuron reconstruction remains extremely time-consuming due to the unprecedentedly large size of EM data. In this paper, we develop an efficient soma reconstruction method for obtaining accurate soma distribution and morphology information in a full adult fly brain. To this end, we first make a high-resolution EM dataset with fine-grained 3D manual annotations on somas. Relying on this dataset, we propose an efficient, two-stage deep learning algorithm for predicting accurate locations and boundaries of 3D soma instances. Further, we deploy a parallelized, high-throughput data processing pipeline for executing the above algorithm on the full brain. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative benchmark comparisons on the testset to validate the superiority of the proposed method, as well as preliminary statistics of the reconstructed somas in the full adult fly brain from the biological perspective. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/liuxy1103/EMADS.

    * Abstract: Generalizable 3D part segmentation is important but challenging in vision and robotics. Training deep models via conventional supervised methods requires large-scale 3D datasets with fine-grained part annotations, which are costly to collect. This paper explores an alternative way for low-shot part segmentation of 3D point clouds by leveraging a pretrained image-language model, GLIP, which achieves superior performance on open-vocabulary 2D detection. We transfer the rich knowledge from 2D to 3D through GLIP-based part detection on point cloud rendering and a novel 2D-to-3D label lifting algorithm. We also utilize multi-view 3D priors and few-shot prompt tuning to boost performance significantly. Extensive evaluation on PartNet and PartNet-Mobility datasets shows that our method enables excellent zero-shot 3D part segmentation. Our few-shot version not only outperforms existing few-shot approaches by a large margin but also achieves highly competitive results compared to the fully supervised counterpart. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be directly applied to iPhone-scanned point clouds without significant domain gaps.

    * Abstract: Animating a virtual character based on a real performance of an actor is a challenging task that currently requires expensive motion capture setups and additional effort by expert animators, rendering it accessible only to large production houses. The goal of our work is to democratize this task by developing a frugal alternative termed "Transfer4D" that uses only commodity depth sensors and further reduces animators' effort by automating the rigging and animation transfer process. To handle sparse, incomplete videos from depth video inputs and large variations between source and target objects, we propose to use skeletons as an intermediary representation between motion capture and transfer. We propose a novel skeleton extraction pipeline from single-view depth sequence that incorporates additional geometric information, resulting in superior performance in motion reconstruction and transfer in comparison to the contemporary methods. We use non-rigid reconstruction to track motion from the depth sequence, and then we rig the source object using skinning decomposition. Finally, the rig is embedded into the target object for motion retargeting.

    * Abstract: A vast amount of images and pixel-wise annotations allowed our community to build scalable segmentation solutions for natural domains. However, the transfer to expert-driven domains like microscopy applications or medical healthcare remains difficult as domain experts are a critical factor due to their limited availability for providing pixel-wise annotations. To enable affordable segmentation solutions for such domains, we need training strategies which can simultaneously handle diverse annotation types and are not bound to costly pixel-wise annotations. In this work, we analyze existing training algorithms towards their flexibility for different annotation types and scalability to small annotation regimes. We conduct an extensive evaluation in the challenging domain of organelle segmentation and find that existing semi- and semi-weakly supervised training algorithms are not able to fully exploit diverse annotation types. Driven by our findings, we introduce Decoupled Semantic Prototypes (DSP) as a training method for semantic segmentation which enables learning from annotation types as diverse as image-level-, point-, bounding box-, and pixel-wise annotations and which leads to remarkable accuracy gains over existing solutions for semi-weakly segmentation.

    * Abstract: Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) attempts to localize the actions in untrimmed videos using only video-level supervision. Most recent works approach WTAL from a localization-by-classification perspective where these methods try to classify each video frame followed by a manually-designed post-processing pipeline to aggregate these per-frame action predictions into action snippets. Due to this perspective, the model lacks any explicit understanding of action boundaries and tends to focus only on the most discriminative parts of the video resulting in incomplete action localization. To address this, we present PivoTAL, Prior-driven Supervision for Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization, to approach WTAL from a localization-by-localization perspective by learning to localize the action snippets directly. To this end, PivoTAL leverages the underlying spatio-temporal regularities in videos in the form of action-specific scene prior, action snippet generation prior, and learnable Gaussian prior to supervise the localization-based training. PivoTAL shows significant improvement (of at least 3% avg mAP) over all existing methods on the benchmark datasets, THUMOS-14 and ActivitNet-v1.3.

    * Abstract: Analogical reasoning enables agents to extract relevant information from scenes, and efficiently navigate them in familiar ways. While progressive-matrix problems (PMPs) are becoming popular for the development and evaluation of analogical reasoning in computer vision, we argue that the dominant methodology in this area struggles to expose the lack of meaningful generalisation in solvers, and reinforces an objectivist stance on perception -- that objects can only be seen one way -- which we believe to be counter-productive. In this paper, we introduce the Unicode Analogies challenge, consisting of polysemic, character-based PMPs to benchmark fluid conceptualisation ability in vision systems. Writing systems have evolved characters at multiple levels of abstraction, from iconic through to symbolic representations, producing both visually interrelated yet exceptionally diverse images when compared to those exhibited by existing PMP datasets. Our framework has been designed to challenge models by presenting tasks much harder to complete without robust feature extraction, while remaining largely solvable by human participants. We therefore argue that Unicode Analogies elegantly captures and tests for a facet of human visual reasoning that is severely lacking in current-generation AI.

    * Authors: Haithem Turki, Jason Y. Zhang, Francesco Ferroni, Deva Ramanan
    * Abstract: We extend neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to dynamic large-scale urban scenes. Prior work tends to reconstruct single video clips of short durations (up to 10 seconds). Two reasons are that such methods (a) tend to scale linearly with the number of moving objects and input videos because a separate model is built for each and (b) tend to require supervision via 3D bounding boxes and panoptic labels, obtained manually or via category-specific models. As a step towards truly open-world reconstructions of dynamic cities, we introduce two key innovations: (a) we factorize the scene into three separate hash table data structures to efficiently encode static, dynamic, and far-field radiance fields, and (b) we make use of unlabeled target signals consisting of RGB images, sparse LiDAR, off-the-shelf self-supervised 2D descriptors, and most importantly, 2D optical flow. Operationalizing such inputs via photometric, geometric, and feature-metric reconstruction losses enables SUDS to decompose dynamic scenes into the static background, individual objects, and their motions. When combined with our multi-branch table representation, such reconstructions can be scaled to tens of thousands of objects across 1.2 million frames from 1700 videos spanning geospatial footprints of hundreds of kilometers, (to our knowledge) the largest dynamic NeRF built to date. We present qualitative initial results on a variety of tasks enabled by our representations, including novel-view synthesis of dynamic urban scenes, unsupervised 3D instance segmentation, and unsupervised 3D cuboid detection. To compare to prior work, we also evaluate on KITTI and Virtual KITTI 2, surpassing state-of-the-art methods that rely on ground truth 3D bounding box annotations while being 10x quicker to train.

    * Abstract: 2D-based Industrial Anomaly Detection has been widely discussed, however, multimodal industrial anomaly detection based on 3D point clouds and RGB images still has many untouched fields. Existing multimodal industrial anomaly detection methods directly concatenate the multimodal features, which leads to a strong disturbance between features and harms the detection performance. In this paper, we propose Multi-3D-Memory (M3DM), a novel multimodal anomaly detection method with hybrid fusion scheme: firstly, we design an unsupervised feature fusion with patch-wise contrastive learning to encourage the interaction of different modal features; secondly, we use a decision layer fusion with multiple memory banks to avoid loss of information and additional novelty classifiers to make the final decision. We further propose a point feature alignment operation to better align the point cloud and RGB features. Extensive experiments show that our multimodal industrial anomaly detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both detection and segmentation precision on MVTec-3D AD dataset.

    * Authors: Xuan Zhang, Shiyu Li, Xi Li, Ping Huang, Jiulong Shan, Ting Chen
    * Abstract: Visual anomaly detection, an important problem in computer vision, is usually formulated as a one-class classification and segmentation task. The student-teacher (S-T) framework has proved to be effective in solving this challenge. However, previous works based on S-T only empirically applied constraints on normal data and fused multi-level information. In this study, we propose an improved model called DeSTSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student encoder-decoder, and a segmentation network into one framework. First, to strengthen the constraints on anomalous data, we introduce a denoising procedure that allows the student network to learn more robust representations. From synthetically corrupted normal images, we train the student network to match the teacher network feature of the same images without corruption. Second, to fuse the multi-level S-T features adaptively, we train a segmentation network with rich supervision from synthetic anomaly masks, achieving a substantial performance improvement. Experiments on the industrial inspection benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, 98.6% on image-level AUC, 75.8% on pixel-level average precision, and 76.4% on instance-level average precision.

    * Authors: Zekun Zhang, Minh Hoai
    * Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to improve the performance of a trained object detector on scenes with fixed camera perspectives based on self-supervised adaptation. Given a specific scene, the trained detector is adapted using pseudo-ground truth labels generated by the detector itself and an object tracker in a cross-teaching manner. When the camera perspective is fixed, our method can utilize the background equivariance by proposing artifact-free object mixup as a means of data augmentation, and utilize accurate background extraction as an additional input modality. We also introduce a large-scale and diverse dataset for the development and evaluation of scene-adaptive object detection. Experiments on this dataset show that our method can improve the average precision of the original detector, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art self-supervised domain adaptive object detection methods by a large margin.

    * Authors: Vedrana Andersen Dahl, Anders Bjorholm Dahl
    * Abstract: We propose a fast algorithm for the computation of local thickness in 2D and 3D. Compared to the conventional algorithm, our fast algorithm yields local thickness in just a fraction of the time. In our algorithm, we first compute the distance field of the object and then iteratively dilate the selected parts of the distance field. In every iteration, we employ small structuring elements, which makes our approach fast. Our algorithm is implemented in Python and is freely available as a pip-installable module. Besides giving a detailed description of our method, we test our implementation on 2D images and 3D volumes. In 2D, we compute the ground truth using the conventional local thickness methods, where the distance field is dilated with increasingly larger circular structuring elements. We use this as a reference to evaluate the quality of our results. In 3D, we have no ground truth since it would be too time-consuming to compute. Instead, we compare our results with the golden standard method provided by BoneJ. In both 2D and 3D, we compare with another Python-based approach from PoreSpy. Our algorithm performs equally well or better than other approaches, but significantly faster.

    * Abstract: Using Machine Learning (ML) models for safety-critical perception tasks in Autonomous Driving (AD) or other domains requires a thorough evaluation of the model performance and the data coverage w.r.t. the intended Operational Design Domain (ODD). However, obtaining the needed per-image semantic meta-data along the relevant dimensions of the ODD for real-world image datasets is non-trivial. Recent advances in self-supervised foundation models, specifically CLIP, suggest that such meta-data could be obtained for real-world images in an automated fashion using zero-shot classification. While CLIP was already reported to achieve promising performance on tasks such as the recognition of gender or age on facial images, we investigate to which extent less prominent and more fine-grained observables, e.g., presence of accessories such as spectacles or the shirt- or hair-color, can be determined. We provide an analysis of CLIP for generating fine-grained meta-data on three datasets from the AD domain, one of synthetic origin including ground truth, the others being Cityscapes and Railsem19. We also compare with a standard facial dataset where more elaborate attribute annotations are present. To improve the quality of generated meta-data, we additionally extend the ensemble approach of CLIP by a simple noise-suppressing technique.

    * Abstract: We present a novel multi-modal data fusion technique using topological features. The method, TopFusion, leverages the flexibility of topological data analysis tools (namely persistent homology and persistence images) to map multi-modal datasets into a common feature space by forming a new multi-channel persistence image. Each channel in the image is representative of a view of the data from a modality-dependent filtration. We demonstrate that the topological perspective we take allows for more effective data reconstruction, i.e. imputation. In particular, by performing imputation in topological feature space we are able to outperform the same imputation techniques applied to raw data or alternatively derived features. We show that TopFusion representations can be used as input to downstream deep learning-based computer vision models and doing so achieves comparable performance to other fusion methods for classification on two multi-modal datasets.

    * Abstract: The rapidly growing scale of data in practice poses demands on the efficiency of retrieval models. However for fine-grained image retrieval task there are inherent contradictions in the design of hashing based efficient models. Firstly the limited information embedding capacity of low-dimensional binary hash codes coupled with the detailed information required to describe fine-grained categories results in a contradiction in feature learning. Secondly there is also a contradiction between the complexity of fine-grained feature extraction models and retrieval efficiency. To address these issues in this paper we propose the characteristics matching based hash codes generation method. Coupled with the cross-layer semantic information transfer module and the multi-region feature embedding module the proposed method can generate hash codes that effectively capture fine-grained differences among samples while ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: A versatile medical image segmentation model applicable to images acquired with diverse equipment and protocols can facilitate model deployment and maintenance. However building such a model typically demands a large diverse and fully annotated dataset which is challenging to obtain due to the labor-intensive nature of data curation. To address this challenge we propose a cost-effective alternative that harnesses multi-source data with only partial or sparse segmentation labels for training substantially reducing the cost of developing a versatile model. We devise strategies for model self-disambiguation prior knowledge incorporation and imbalance mitigation to tackle challenges associated with inconsistently labeled multi-source data including label ambiguity and modality dataset and class imbalances. Experimental results on a multi-modal dataset compiled from eight different sources for abdominal structure segmentation have demonstrated the effectiveness and superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternative approaches. We anticipate that its cost-saving features which optimize the utilization of existing annotated data and reduce annotation efforts for new data will have a significant impact in the field.

    * Abstract: Colorizing line art is a pivotal task in the production of hand-drawn cel animation. This typically involves digital painters using a paint bucket tool to manually color each segment enclosed by lines based on RGB values predetermined by a color designer. This frame-by-frame process is both arduous and time-intensive. Current automated methods mainly focus on segment matching. This technique migrates colors from a reference to the target frame by aligning features within line-enclosed segments across frames. However issues like occlusion and wrinkles in animations often disrupt these direct correspondences leading to mismatches. In this work we introduce a new learning-based inclusion matching pipeline which directs the network to comprehend the inclusion relationships between segments rather than relying solely on direct visual correspondences. Our method features a two-stage pipeline that integrates a coarse color warping module with an inclusion matching module enabling more nuanced and accurate colorization. To facilitate the training of our network we also develope a unique dataset referred to as PaintBucket-Character. This dataset includes rendered line arts alongside their colorized counterparts featuring various 3D characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing techniques.

    * Abstract: State-of-the-art man-made shape generative models usually adopt established generative models under a suitable implicit shape representation. A common theme is to perform distribution alignment which does not explicitly model important shape priors. As a result many synthetic shapes are not connected. Other synthetic shapes present problems of physical stability and geometric feasibility. This paper introduces a novel latent diffusion shape-generative model regularized by a quality checker that outputs a score of a latent code. The scoring function employs a learned function that provides a geometric feasibility score and a deterministic procedure to quantify a physical stability score. The key to our approach is a new diffusion procedure that combines the discrete empirical data distribution and a continuous distribution induced by the quality checker. We introduce a principled approach to determine the tradeoff parameters for learning the denoising network at different noise levels. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art shape generations quantitatively and qualitatively on ShapeNet-v2.

    * Abstract: In recent years the thriving development of research related to egocentric videos has provided a unique perspective for the study of conversational interactions where both visual and audio signals play a crucial role. While most prior work focus on learning about behaviors that directly involve the camera wearer we introduce the Ego-Exocentric Conversational Graph Prediction problem marking the first attempt to infer exocentric conversational interactions from egocentric videos. We propose a unified multi-modal framework---Audio-Visual Conversational Attention (AV-CONV) for the joint prediction of conversation behaviors---speaking and listening---for both the camera wearer as well as all other social partners present in the egocentric video. Specifically we adopt the self-attention mechanism to model the representations across-time across-subjects and across-modalities. To validate our method we conduct experiments on a challenging egocentric video dataset that includes multi-speaker and multi-conversation scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to a series of baselines. We also present detailed ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in our model.

Our dataset represents real interiors and contains a diverse set of 18656 models of real-world objects. We investigate the impact of synthetic 3D scene dataset scale and realism on the task of training embodied agents to find and navigate to objects (ObjectGoal navigation). By comparing to synthetic 3D scene datasets from prior work we find that scale helps in generalization but the benefits quickly saturate making visual fidelity and correlation to real-world scenes more important. Our experiments show that agents trained on our smaller-scale dataset can match or outperform agents trained on much larger datasets. Surprisingly we observe that agents trained on just 122 scenes from our dataset outperform agents trained on 10000 scenes from the ProcTHOR-10K dataset in terms of zero-shot generalization in real-world scanned environments.

    * Abstract: The realism of digital avatars is crucial in enabling telepresence applications with self-expression and customization. While physical simulations can produce realistic motions for clothed humans they require high-quality garment assets with associated physical parameters for cloth simulations. However manually creating these assets and calibrating their parameters is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. Current methods focus on reconstructing geometry but don't generate complete assets for physics-based applications. To address this gap we propose DiffAvatar a novel approach that performs body and garment co-optimization using differentiable simulation. By integrating physical simulation into the optimization loop and accounting for the complex nonlinear behavior of cloth and its intricate interaction with the body our framework recovers body and garment geometry and extracts important material parameters in a physically plausible way. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach generates realistic clothing and body shape suitable for downstream applications. We provide additional insights and results on our webpage: people.csail.mit.edu/liyifei/publication/diffavatar.

    * Abstract: Group synchronization plays a crucial role in global pipelines for Structure from Motion (SfM). Its formulation is nonconvex and it is faced with highly corrupted measurements. Cycle consistency has been effective in addressing these challenges. However computationally efficient solutions are needed for cycles longer than three especially in practical scenarios where 3-cycles are unavailable. To overcome this computational bottleneck we propose an algorithm for group synchronization that leverages information from cycles of lengths ranging from three to six with a complexity of O(n^3) (or O(n^ 2.373 ) when using a faster matrix multiplication algorithm). We establish non-trivial theory for this and related methods that achieves competitive sample complexity assuming the uniform corruption model. To advocate the practical need for our method we consider distributed group synchronization which requires at least 4-cycles and we illustrate state-of-the-art performance by our method in this context.

However their capabilities lag behind those offered by conventional representations such as 2D videos because of algorithmic challenges and the lack of large-scale multi-view real-world datasets. We address the dataset limitation with DiVa-360 a real-world 360? dynamic visual dataset that contains synchronized high-resolution and long-duration multi-view video sequences of table-scale scenes captured using a customized low-cost system with 53 cameras. It contains 21 object-centric sequences categorized by different motion types 25 intricate hand-object interaction sequences and 8 long-duration sequences for a total of 17.4 M image frames. In addition we provide foreground-background segmentation masks synchronized audio and text descriptions. We benchmark the state-of-the-art dynamic neural field methods on DiVa-360 and provide insights about existing methods and future challenges on long-duration neural field capture.

    * Abstract: Instance segmentation of neurons in volumetric light microscopy images of nervous systems enables groundbreaking research in neuroscience by facilitating joint functional and morphological analyses of neural circuits at cellular resolution. Yet said multi-neuron light microscopy data exhibits extremely challenging properties for the task of instance segmentation: Individual neurons have long-ranging thin filamentous and widely branching morphologies multiple neurons are tightly inter-weaved and partial volume effects uneven illumination and noise inherent to light microscopy severely impede local disentangling as well as long-range tracing of individual neurons. These properties reflect a current key challenge in machine learning research namely to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the data. While respective methodological research is buzzing to date methods are typically benchmarked on synthetic datasets. To address this gap we release the FlyLight Instance Segmentation Benchmark (FISBe) dataset the first publicly available multi-neuron light microscopy dataset with pixel-wise annotations. In addition we define a set of instance segmentation metrics for benchmarking that we designed to be meaningful with regard to downstream analyses. Lastly we provide three baselines to kick off a competition that we envision to both advance the field of machine learning regarding methodology for capturing long-range data dependencies and facilitate scientific discovery in basic neuroscience.

    * Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for their ability to effectively approximate large classes of functions. This flexibility however makes the strict enforcement of constraints on DNNs a difficult problem. In contexts where it is critical to limit the function space to which certain network components belong such as wavelets employed in Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) naive constraints via additional terms in the loss function are inadequate. To address this we introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) wherein the convolutional filters are strictly constrained to be wavelets. This allows the filters to update to task-optimized wavelets during the training procedure. Our primary contribution lies in the rigorous formulation of these filters via a constrained empirical risk minimization framework thereby providing an exact mechanism to enforce these structural constraints. While our work is grounded in theory we investigate our approach empirically through applications in medical imaging particularly in the task of contour prediction around various organs achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods.

    * Abstract: Visual interactivity understanding within visual scenes presents a significant challenge in computer vision. Existing methods focus on complex interactivities while leveraging a simple relationship model. These methods however struggle with a diversity of appearance situation position interaction and relation in videos. This limitation hinders the ability to fully comprehend the interplay within the complex visual dynamics of subjects. In this paper we delve into interactivities understanding within visual content by deriving scene graph representations from dense interactivities among humans and objects. To achieve this goal we first present a new dataset containing Appearance-Situation-Position-Interaction-Relation predicates named ASPIRe offering an extensive collection of videos marked by a wide range of interactivities. Then we propose a new approach named Hierarchical Interlacement Graph (HIG) which leverages a unified layer and graph within a hierarchical structure to provide deep insights into scene changes across five distinct tasks. Our approach demonstrates superior performance to other methods through extensive experiments conducted in various scenarios.

    * Abstract: Manually creating 3D environments for AR/VR applications is a complex process requiring expert knowledge in 3D modeling software. Pioneering works facilitate this process by generating room meshes conditioned on textual style descriptions. Yet many of these automatically generated 3D meshes do not adhere to typical room layouts compromising their plausibility e.g. by placing several beds in one bedroom. To address these challenges we present ControlRoom3D a novel method to generate high-quality room meshes. Central to our approach is a user-defined 3D semantic proxy room that outlines a rough room layout based on semantic bounding boxes and a textual description of the overall room style. Our key insight is that when rendered to 2D this 3D representation provides valuable geometric and semantic information to control powerful 2D models to generate 3D consistent textures and geometry that aligns well with the proxy room. Backed up by an extensive study including quantitative metrics and qualitative user evaluations our method generates diverse and globally plausible 3D room meshes thus empowering users to design 3D rooms effortlessly without specialized knowledge.

    * Abstract: How important is it for training and evaluation sets to not have class overlap in image retrieval? We revisit Google Landmarks v2 clean the most popular training set by identifying and removing class overlap with Revisited Oxford and Paris the most popular training set. By comparing the original and the new RGLDv2-clean on a benchmark of reproduced state-of-the-art methods our findings are striking. Not only is there a dramatic drop in performance but it is inconsistent across methods changing the ranking. What does it take to focus on objects or interest and ignore background clutter when indexing? Do we need to analyze the evaluation set? Do we need to train an object detector and the representation separately? Do we need location supervision? We introduce Single-stage Detect-to-Retrieve (CiDeR) an end-to-end single-stage pipeline to detect objects of interest and extract a global image representation. We outperform previous state-of-the-art on both existing training sets and the new RGLDv2-clean.

    * Abstract: Text-to-image generation has achieved astonishing results yet precise spatial controllability and prompt fidelity remain highly challenging. This limitation is typically addressed through cumbersome prompt engineering scene layout conditioning or image editing techniques which often require hand drawn masks. Nonetheless pre-existing works struggle to take advantage of the natural instance-level compositionality of scenes due to the typically flat nature of rasterized RGB output images. Towards addressing this challenge we introduce MuLAn: a novel dataset comprising over 44K MUlti-Layer ANnotations of RGB images as multi-layer instance-wise RGBA decompositions and over 100K instance images. To build MuLAn we developed a training free pipeline which decomposes a monocular RGB image into a stack of RGBA layers comprising of background and isolated instances. We achieve this through the use of pretrained general-purpose models and by developing three modules: image decomposition for instance discovery and extraction instance completion to reconstruct occluded areas and image re-assembly. We use our pipeline to create MuLAn-COCO and MuLAn-LAION datasets which contain a variety of image decompositions in terms of style composition and complexity. With MuLAn we provide the first photorealistic resource providing instance decomposition and occlusion information for high quality images opening up new avenues for text-to-image generative AI research. With this we aim to encourage the development of novel generation and editing technology in particular layer-wise solutions. MuLAn data resources are available at https://MuLAn-dataset.github.io/

    * Abstract: Extracting planes from a 3D scene is useful for downstream tasks in robotics and augmented reality. In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the planar surfaces in a scene from posed images. Our first finding is that a surprisingly competitive baseline results from combining popular clustering algorithms with recent improvements in 3D geometry estimation. However such purely geometric methods are understandably oblivious to plane semantics which are crucial to discerning distinct planes. To overcome this limitation we propose a method that predicts multi-view consistent plane embeddings that complement geometry when clustering points into planes. We show through extensive evaluation on the ScanNetV2 dataset that our new method outperforms existing approaches and our strong geometric baseline for the task of plane estimation.

    * Abstract: Interactive Segmentation (IS) segments specific objects or parts in the image according to user input. Current IS pipelines fall into two categories: single-granularity output and multi-granularity output. The latter aims to alleviate the spatial ambiguity present in the former. However the multi-granularity output pipeline suffers from limited interaction flexibility and produces redundant results. In this work we introduce Granularity-Controllable Interactive Segmentation (GraCo) a novel approach that allows precise control of prediction granularity by introducing additional parameters to input. This enhances the customization of the interactive system and eliminates redundancy while resolving ambiguity. Nevertheless the exorbitant cost of annotating multi-granularity masks and the lack of available datasets with granularity annotations make it difficult for models to acquire the necessary guidance to control output granularity. To address this problem we design an any-granularity mask generator that exploits the semantic property of the pre-trained IS model to automatically generate abundant mask-granularity pairs without requiring additional manual annotation. Based on these pairs we propose a granularity-controllable learning strategy that efficiently imparts the granularity controllability to the IS model. Extensive experiments on intricate scenarios at object and part levels demonstrate that our GraCo has significant advantages over previous methods. This highlights the potential of GraCo to be a flexible annotation tool capable of adapting to diverse segmentation scenarios. The project page: https://zhao-yian.github.io/GraCo.

    * Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study on a new task named power battery detection (PBD) which aims to localize the dense cathode and anode plates endpoints from X-ray images to evaluate the quality of power batteries. Existing manufacturers usually rely on human eye observation to complete PBD which makes it difficult to balance the accuracy and efficiency of detection. To address this issue and drive more attention into this meaningful task we first elaborately collect a dataset called X-ray PBD which has 1500 diverse X-ray images selected from thousands of power batteries of 5 manufacturers with 7 different visual interference. Then we propose a novel segmentation-based solution for PBD termed multi-dimensional collaborative network (MDCNet). With the help of line and counting predictors the representation of the point segmentation branch can be improved at both semantic and detail aspects. Besides we design an effective distance-adaptive mask generation strategy which can alleviate the visual challenge caused by the inconsistent distribution density of plates to provide MDCNet with stable supervision. Without any bells and whistles our segmentation-based MDCNet consistently outperforms various other corner detection crowd counting and general/tiny object detection-based solutions making it a strong baseline that can help facilitate future research in PBD. Finally we share some potential difficulties and works for future researches.

    * Abstract: The ChemCam instrument on the Curiosity rover performs geochemical analyses of rocks on Mars using Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). The shockwaves generated during the LIBS measurements sometimes shift dust from the surface of the target. The study of the Martian dust phenomena in the scope of the ChemCam instrument has the potential to provide insight into the planet's geology and aid calibration methods for data processing. In this study we develop a pipeline named Dust Displacement Detection (DDD) for automatic detection of dust displacement on LIBS targets based on the image dataset acquired by ChemCam. To this end we introduce a data preprocessing methodology and test two-stage models with a pretrained model in the first stage for feature extraction and a Random Forest classifier or a Support Vector Machine as a binary classifier in the second stage. The best performing model was found to consist of the first 10 layers of VGG16 and a Random Forest classifier achieving 92% accuracy. Additionally we use Explainable AI (XAI) methods such as Shapley values and guided backpropagation for model optimization. The experiments show potential for model optimization and the application examples presented encourage discussion of machine learning in the field of Martian dust research.

    * Abstract: Optical Pooled Screening (OPS) is a powerful tool combining high-content microscopy with genetic engineering to investigate gene function in disease. The characterization of high-content images remains an active area of research and is currently undergoing rapid innovation through the application of self-supervised learning and vision transformers. In this study we propose a set-level consistency learning algorithm Set-DINO that combines self-supervised learning with weak supervision to improve learned representations of perturbation effects in single-cell images. Our method leverages the replicate structure of OPS experiments (i.e. cells undergoing the same genetic perturbation both within and across batches) as a form of weak supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale OPS dataset with more than 5000 genetic perturbations and demonstrate that Set-DINO helps mitigate the impact of confounders and encodes more biologically meaningful information. In particular Set-DINO recalls known biological relationships with higher accuracy compared to commonly used methods for morphological profiling suggesting that it can generate more reliable insights from drug target discovery campaigns leveraging OPS.

    * Abstract: The delineation of tumor target and organs-at-risk (OARs) is critical in the radiotherapy treatment planning. It is also tedious time-consuming and prone to subjective experiences. Automatic segmentation can be used to reduce the physician's workload. However the quality assurance of the segmentation is an unmet need in clinical practice. In this study we developed an automatic model that detects the errors of the contouring using one-class classifier. The OARs included left and right lungs heart esophagus and spinal cord. Each data includes the ground truth which is manually contoured by experienced doctor and contour generated by a contouring software. We used three metrics to determine whether the contour of an OAR is "high" or "low" quality. A resnet-152 network performed as a feature extractor and a one class support vector machine determines the quality of the contour. We generated certain contour errors to evaluate the generalizability of this method. Furthermore to enhance the interpretability of this method we conducted a set of experiments to assess its detection limit and discussed the correlation between this limit and metrics such as volume DSC HD95 and MSD. The proposed method showed significant improvement over binary classifiers in handling various types of errors. The relationship between the detection limit and multiple factors of the OARs indicates that our method is highly interpretable. Moreover the model's fast execution speed can significantly reduce the burden on physicians.

    * Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is a widely used method in remote sensing particularly for use in airborne and satellite-based land surveillance. Its versatility is however much larger and has also seen usage in everything ranging from food processing and surveillance to astronomy and waste sorting. It is also gaining inroads with agricultural research. With most available datasets focusing on per-pixel classification there is however a potential for hyperspectral whole-image analysis but there is a severe lack of datasets for whole-image analysis. To help fill this gap and facilitate methodological development in whole-image hyperspectral image analysis we introduce the HyperLeaf2024 dataset. The dataset consists of 2410 hyperspectral images of wheat leaves along with associated classification and regression targets at both the leaf level and the plot level. In addition to the dataset we also provide experiments showing the importance of pretraining and highlighting the future research direction in whole-image hyperspectral image analysis.

    * Abstract: An important task for intelligent systems is affordance grounding where the goal is to locate regions on an object where an action can be performed. Past weakly supervised approaches learn from human-object interaction (HOI) by transferring grounding knowledge from exocentric to egocentric views of an object. The use of HOI priors is inherently noisy and thus provides a limited source of supervision. To address this challenge we identify that recent foundational models (i.e. VLMs and LLMs) can serve as auxiliary sources of knowledge for frameworks due to their vast world knowledge. In this work we propose strategies to extract and leverage foundational model knowledge related to attributes and object parts to enhance an HOI-based affordance grounding framework. In particular we propose to combine HOI and foundational model priors through (1) a spatial consistency loss and (2) heatmap aggregation. Our strategies result in mKLD and mNSS improvements and insights suggest future directions for improving affordance grounding capabilities.

    * Abstract: Over the past decade neural network-based super-resolution techniques have been developed on a large scale with impressive achievements. Many novel solutions have been proposed among which lightweight solutions based on convolutional neural networks have been designed for applications in edge devices. To better realize this application we propose a more lightweight attention guidance distillation network (AGDN). We design the attention guidance distillation block (AGDB) with more efficient space channel and self-attention as the infrastructure of AGDN. Specifically multi-level variance-aware spatial attention (MVSA) is designed to better capture structurally information-rich regions with new multi-scale convolution and local variance alignment. Reallocated contrast-aware channel attention (RCCA) is designed to enhance the processing of common information in all channels while redistributing weights across channels. Sparse global self-attention (SGSA) is introduced for selecting the most useful similarity values for image reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDN strikes a better balance between performance and complexity compared to other models achieving SOTA performance on several benchmark tests. In addition our AGDN-S ranks first in the FLOPs track and second in the Parameters track of the NTIRE 2024 Efficient SR Challenge. The code is available at https://github.com/daydreamer2024/AGDN.

    * Abstract: Monitoring marine environments is a crucial part of understanding the impact of oceans on global climate and their importance for biodiversity and ecological systems particularly in the Arctic region. Underwater active acoustic surveys with moored multi-frequency echosounders allow for the continuous collection of valuable data reflecting the complex dynamics of these environments. This paper addresses the automatic identification of sea surface boundaries and near-surface phenomena in echograms using deep learning methods to support researchers such as biologists in their work who typically rely on time-consuming manual analyses. We propose a two-step process that first characterizes echograms according to the surface conditions using an image classification paradigm and then identifies the sea surface boundary and near-surface bubbles and their extent in the water column using a semantic segmentation paradigm. Segmentation is carried out using surface type-specific models which perform better than a single global segmentation model. We also propose learning strategies such as a custom boundary loss function that further improve performance. Experiments with various image classification and semantic segmentation architectures allow us to select the most efficient models for Arctic echogram analysis that when used in conjunction within our proposed pipeline and our learning strategies offer excellent results.

    * Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental research problem in machine learning and computer vision with practical applications in industrial inspection video surveillance and medical diagnosis. In the field of medical imaging AD plays a crucial role in identifying anomalies that may indicate rare diseases or conditions. However despite its importance there is currently a lack of a universal and fair benchmark for evaluating AD methods on medical images which hinders the development of more generalized and robust AD methods in this specific domain. To address this gap we present a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for assessing AD methods on medical images. This benchmark consists of six reorganized datasets from five medical domains (i.e. brain MRI liver CT retinal OCT chest X-ray and digital histopathology) and three key evaluation metrics and includes a total of fifteen state-of-the-art AD algorithms. This standardized and well-curated medical benchmark with the well-structured codebase enables researchers to easily compare and evaluate different AD methods and ultimately leads to the development of more effective and robust AD algorithms for medical imaging.

    * Abstract: Detecting anomalies in images has become a well-explored problem in both academia and industry. State-of-the-art algorithms are able to detect defects in increasingly difficult settings and data modalities. However most current methods are not suited to address 3D objects captured from differing poses. While solutions using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been proposed they suffer from excessive computation requirements which hinder real-world usability. For this reason we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which given multi-view images of a 3D object accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed and detection performance even when using less training data than competing methods. We thoroughly evaluate our framework using the recently proposed Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark and its multi-pose anomaly detection (MAD) data set.

    * Abstract: We take a scene-understanding approach to video anomaly localization (VAL) that leverages the rapid progress that has been made in training general deep networks for object detection object recognition and optical flow. Our method uses each detected object's short-term trajectory appearance embedding size and location as its representation. These high-level attributes provide rich information about the object types and movements that are found in nominal video of a scene. By efficiently comparing the high-level attributes of test objects to those of normal objects our method detects anomalous objects and anomalous movements. In addition the human-understandable attributes used by our method can provide intuitive explanations for its decisions. We evaluate our method on many standard VAL datasets (USCD Ped1/Ped2 CUHK Avenue ShanghaiTech and Street Scene) using spatio-temporal evaluation criteria and demonstrate new state-of-the-art accuracy.

    * Abstract: The intricate manifestations of pathological brain lesions in imaging data pose challenges for supervised detection methods due to the scarcity of annotated samples. To overcome this difficulty our focus shifts to unsupervised anomaly detection. In this work we exclusively train the proposed model using healthy data to identify unseen anomalies during testing. This study entails investigating the triplet-based variational autoencoder to simultaneously learn the distribution of healthy brain data and denoising capabilities. Importantly we rectify a misconception inherent in prior projection-based approaches which relies on the presumption that healthy regions within images would persist unaltered in the reconstructed output. This inadvertently implied a substantial likeness in latent space representations between lesion and lesion-free images. However this assumption might not hold true particularly due to the potential significant impact of lesion area intensities on the projection process notably for autoencoders with single information bottleneck. To overcome this limitation we disentangled metric learning from latent sampling. This approach ensures that both lesion and lesion-free input images are projected into the same distribution specifically the lesion-free projection. Moreover we introduce a semantic-guided gated cross skip module to enhance spatial detail retrieval while suppressing anomalies leveraging robust healthy brain representation semantics exist in the deeper levels of the decoder. We also discovered that incorporating structure similarity index measure as an extra training objective bolsters the capability of anomaly detection for the proposed model.

    * Abstract: Broiler localization is crucial for welfare monitoring particularly in identifying issues such as wet litter. We focus on multi-camera detection systems since multiple viewpoints not only ensure comprehensive pen coverage but also reduce occlusions caused by lighting feeder and drinking equipment. Previous multi-view detection studies localize subjects either by aggregating ground plane projections of single-view predictions or by developing end-to-end multi-view detectors capable of directly generating predictions. However single-view detections may suffer from reduced accuracy due to occlusions and obtaining ground plane labels for training end-to-end multi-view detectors is challenging. In this paper we combine the strengths of both approaches by using the readily available aggregated single-view detections as labels for training a multi-view detector. Our approach alleviates the need for hard-to-acquire ground-plane labels. Through experiments on a real-world broiler dataset we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    * Abstract: Small farms contribute to a large share of the productive land in developing countries. In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa where 80% of farms are small (under 2 ha in size) the task of mapping smallholder cropland is an important part of tracking sustainability measures such as crop productivity. However the visually diverse and nuanced appearance of small farms has limited the effectiveness of traditional approaches to cropland mapping. Here we introduce a new approach based on the detection of harvest piles characteristic of many smallholder systems throughout the world. We present HarvestNet a dataset for mapping the presence of farms in the Ethiopian regions of Tigray and Amhara during 2020-2023 collected using expert knowledge and satellite images totaling 7k hand-labeled images and 2k ground-collected labels. We also benchmark a set of baselines including SOTA models in remote sensing with our best models having around 80% classification performance on hand labelled data and 90% and 98% accuracy on ground truth data for Tigray and Amhara respectively. We also perform a visual comparison with a widely used pre-existing coverage map and show that our model detects an extra 56621 hectares of cropland in Tigray. We conclude that remote sensing of harvest piles can contribute to more timely and accurate cropland assessments in food insecure regions. The dataset can be accessed through https://figshare.com/s/45a7b45556b90a9a11d2 while the code for the dataset and benchmarks is publicly available at https://github.com/jonxuxu/harvest-piles.

    * Abstract: Splits on canned beans appear in the process of preparation and canning. Researchers are studying how they are influenced by cooking environment and genotype. However, there is no existing method to automatically quantify or to characterize the severity of splits. To solve this, we propose two measures: the Bean Split Ratio (BSR) that quantifies the overall severity of splits, and the Bean Split Histogram (BSH) that characterizes the size distribution of splits. We create a pixel-wise segmentation method to automatically estimate these measures from images. We also present a bean dataset of recombinant inbred lines of two genotypes, use the BSR and BSH to assess canning quality, and explore heritability of these properties.

    * Abstract: Methods for automated 3D urban modeling typically result in very dense point clouds or surface meshes derived from either overhead lidar or imagery (multiview stereo). Such models are very large and have no semantic separation of individual structures (i.e. buildings, bridges) from the terrain. Furthermore, such dense models often appear "melted" and do not capture sharp edges. This paper demonstrates an end-to-end system for segmenting buildings and bridges from terrain and estimating simple, low polygon, textured mesh models of these structures. The approach uses multiview-stereo satellite imagery as a starting point, but this work focuses on segmentation methods and regularized 3D surface extraction. Our work is evaluated on the IARPA CORE3D public data set using the associated ground truth and metrics. A web-based application deployed on AWS runs the algorithms and provides visualization of the results. Both the algorithms and web application are provided as open source software as a resource for further research or product development.

    * Abstract: We propose an efficient and effective control point extraction algorithm for parametric skeleton generation. The object skeleton pixels are predicted via an hourglass network and partitioned into skeleton branches using Gaussian Mixture Models. For each skeleton branch, a Bezier curve is utilized to generate the control points. The radius of the skeleton is computed by the distance between the border of the object and the Bezier curve. The branches are sorted by the area so that the parametric skeleton representation is unique. For the Parametric SkelNetOn competition, the proposed approach achieves the prediction score of 11793.89, which is in the first place on the performance leader-board.

    * Abstract: Commonly used metrics to evaluate semantic segmentation such as mean intersection over union (mIoU) do not incorporate temporal consistency. A straightforward extension of existing metrics towards evaluating the consistency of segmentation of video sequences does not exist, since labelled videos are rare and very expensive to obtain. For safety-critical applications such as highly automated driving, there is, however, a need for a metric that measures such temporal consistency of video segmentation networks to possibly support safety requirements. In this paper, (a) we introduce a metric which does not require segmentation labels for measuring the stability of the predictions of segmentation networks over a series of images; (b) we perform an in-depth analysis of the proposed metric and observe strong correlations to the supervised mIoU metric; (c) we perform an evaluation of five state-of-the-art networks for semantic segmentation of varying complexities and architectures evaluated on two public datasets, namely, Cityscapes and CamVid. Finally, we perform timing evaluations and propose the use of the metric as either an online observer for identification of possibly unstable segmentation predictions, or as an offline method to evaluate or to improve semantic segmentation networks, e.g., by selecting additional training data with critical temporal consistency.

We focus on aspects that enable deep-learning-based object classification in realtime on low-end ARM-based hardware, which is prerequisite for a solution that is performant yet affordable, low-power, and unobtrusive. To this end, we introduce an efficient vision pipeline that maps the input depth data to concise virtual top-views. These views are then processed by a set of convolutional neural networks, with a scheduler selecting the most appropriate one based on the current operating conditions and available hardware resources. In order to overcome the challenge of acquiring large amounts of training data in this privacy-critical environment, we pretrain these networks on a large set of synthetic depth data. These concepts are general and applicable to similar vision tasks.

    * Abstract: Scene text detection is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision and has attr!acted great interest. In general, scene text detection methods are divided into two categories: detection-based and segmentation-based methods. Recently, the segmentation-based methods are more and more popular due to their superior performances and the advantages of detecting arbitrary-shape texts. However, there still exist the following problems: (a) the misclassification of the unexpected texts, (b) the split of long text lines, (c) the failure of separating very close text instances. In this paper, we propose an accurate segmentation-based detector, which is equipped with context attention and repulsive text border. The context attention incorporates global channel attention, non-local self-attention and spatial attention to better exploit the global and local context, which can greatly increase the discriminative ability for pixels. Due to the enhancement of pixel-level features, false positives and the misdetections of long texts are reduced. Besides, for the purpose of solving very close text instance, a repulsive pixel link, which focuses on the relationships between pixels at the border, is proposed. Experiments on several standard benchmarks, including MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015, ICDAR2017-MLT and CTW1500, validate the superiority of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: An automatic table recognition method for interpretation of tabular data in document images majorly involves solving two problems of table detection and table structure recognition. The prior work involved solving both problems independently using two separate approaches. More recent works signify the use of deep learning-based solutions while also attempting to design an end to end solution. In this paper, we present an improved deep learning-based end to end approach for solving both problems of table detection and structure recognition using a single Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model. We propose CascadeTabNet: a Cascade mask Region-based CNN High-Resolution Network (Cascade mask R-CNN HRNet) based model that detects the regions of tables and recognizes the structural body cells from the detected tables at the same time. We evaluate our results on ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2019 and TableBank public datasets. We achieved 3rd rank in ICDAR 2019 post-competition results for table detection while attaining the best accuracy results for the ICDAR 2013 and TableBank dataset. We also attain the highest accuracy results on the ICDAR 2019 table structure recognition dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate effective transfer learning and image augmentation techniques that enable CNNs to achieve very accurate table detection results.

    * Abstract: While semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms provide an efficient way to make use of both labelled and unlabelled data, they generally struggle when the number of annotated samples is very small. In this work, we consider the problem of SSL multi-class classification with very few labelled instances. We introduce two key ideas. The first is a simple but effective one: we leverage the power of transfer learning among different tasks and self-supervision to initialize a good representation of the data without making use of any label. The second idea is a new algorithm for SSL that can exploit well such a pre-trained representation. The algorithm works by alternating two phases, one fitting the labelled points and one fitting the unlabelled ones, with carefully-controlled information flow between them. The benefits are greatly reducing overfitting of the labelled data and avoiding issue with balancing labelled and unlabelled losses during training. We show empirically that this method can successfully train competitive models with as few as 10 labelled data points per class. More in general, we show that the idea of bootstrapping features using self-supervised learning always improves SSL on standard benchmarks. We show that our algorithm works increasingly well compared to other methods when refining from other tasks or datasets.

    * Abstract: Fine-Grained Recognition aims to classify sub-category objects such as bird species and car models from imagery. In High-throughput Phenotyping, the required task is to classify individual plant cultivars to assist plant breeding, which has posed three challenges: 1) it is easy to overfit complex features and models, 2) visual conditions change during and between image collection opportunities, and 3) analysis of thousands of cultivars require high-throughput data collection and analysis. To tackle these challenges, we propose a simple but intuitive descriptor, Radial Object Descriptor, to represent plant cultivar objects based on contour. This descriptor is invariant under scaling, rotation, and translation, as well as robust under changes to the plant's growth stage and camera's view angle. Furthermore, we complement this mid-level feature by fusing it with the low-level features (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and deep features (ResNet-18), respectively. We extensively test our fusion approaches using two real world experiments. One experiment is on a novel benchmark dataset (HTP-Soy) in which we collect 2,000 high-resolution aerial images of outdoor soybean plots. Another experiment is on three datasets of indoor rosette plants. For both experiments, our fusion approaches achieve superior accuracies while maintaining better generalization as compared with traditional approaches.

    * Abstract: We study natural human activity under difficult settings of cluttered background, volatile illumination, and frequent occlusion. To that end, a two-stage method for hand and hand-object interaction detection is developed. First, activity proposals are generated from multiple sub-regions in the scene. Then, these are integrated using a second-stage classifier. We study a set of descriptors for detection and activity recognition in terms of performance and speed. With the overarching goal of reducing 'lab setting bias', a case study is introduced with a publicly available annotated RGB and depth dataset. The dataset was captured using a Kinect under real-world driving settings. The approach is motivated by studying actions-as well as semantic elements in the scene and the driver's interaction with them-which may be used to infer driver inattentiveness. The proposed framework significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline on our dataset for hand detection.

    * Abstract: Light field rendering is a widely used technique to generate novel views of a scene from novel viewpoints. Interpolative methods for light field rendering require a dense description of the scene in the form of closely spaced images. In this work, we present a simple method for dense view interpolation over general static scenes, using commonly available mobile devices. We capture an approximate focal stack of the scene from adjacent camera locations and interpolate intermediate images by shifting each focal region according to appropriate disparities. We do not rely on focus distance control to capture focal stacks and describe an automatic method of estimating the focal textures and the blur and disparity parameters required for view interpolation.

    * Abstract: This paper presents a perspective rectification framework for mobile device that is fast and robust to recovering the fronto-parallel view of perspectively distorted document images. The conventional approaches is too heavy to be implemented on a mobile device. In addition, they fails to reject the false case of the perspective rectification. To ameliorate such problems, the proposed framework is designed to pursue a fast and robust algorithm to detect horizontal and vertical vanishing points efficiently and robustly. Then, perspective rectification is performed using both horizontal and vertical vanishing points. In addition, the proposed framework has an adaptive scheme to detect the false case of the perspective rectification and skip the procedure without using the vertical vanishing point. Note that, the proposed framework is designed for consumer application so that bad results are rejected before they are shown for users. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework on various challenging examples to confirm that the proposed system is fast and robust in rectifying the perspectively distorted images.

    * Authors: Suren Kumar, Tim K. Marks, Michael Jones
    * Abstract: This paper proposes a person tracking framework using a scanning low-resolution thermal infrared (IR) sensor colocated with a wide-angle RGB camera. The low temporal and spatial resolution of the low-cost IR sensor make it unable to track moving people and prone to false detections of stationary people. Thus, IR-only tracking using only this sensor would be quite problematic. We demonstrate that despite the limited capabilities of this low-cost IR sensor, it can be used effectively to correct the errors of a real-time RGB camera-based tracker. We align the signals from the two sensors both spatially (by computing a pixel-to-pixel geometric correspondence between the two modalities) and temporally (by modeling the temporal dynamics of the scanning IR sensor), which enables multi-modal improvements based on judicious application of elementary reasoning. Our combined RGB+IR system improves upon the RGB camera-only tracking by: rejecting false positives, improving segmentation of tracked objects, and correcting false negatives (starting new tracks for people that were missed by the camera-only tracker). Since we combine RGB and thermal information at the level of RGB camera-based tracks, our method is not limited to the particular camera-based tracker that we used in our experiments. Our method could improve the results of any tracker that uses RGB camera input alone. We collect a new dataset and demonstrate the superiority of our method over RGB camera-only tracking.

    * Abstract: In many visual surveillance applications the task of person detection and localization can be solved easier by using thermal long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras which are less affected by changing illumination or background texture than visual-optical cameras. Especially in outdoor scenes where usually only few hot spots appear in thermal infrared imagery, humans can be detected more reliably due to their prominent infrared signature. We propose a two-stage person recognition approach for LWIR images: (1) the application of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) to detect hot spots instead of background subtraction or sliding window and (2) the verification of the detected hot spots using a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based descriptor and a modified Random Naïve Bayes (RNB) classifier. The main contributions are the novel modified RNB classifier and the generality of our method. We achieve high detection rates for several different LWIR datasets with low resolution videos in real-time. While many papers in this topic are dealing with strong constraints such as considering only one dataset, assuming a stationary camera, or detecting only moving persons, we aim at avoiding such constraints to make our approach applicable with moving platforms such as Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV).

    * Abstract: 3D microstructures are important for material scientists to analyze physical properties of materials. While such microstructures are too small to be directly visible to human vision, modern microscopic and serial-sectioning techniques can provide their high-resolution 3D images in the form of a sequence of 2D image slices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the Edge-Weighted Centroid Voronoi Tessellation which uses propagation of the inter-slice consistency constraint. It can segment a 3D superalloy image, slice by slice, to obtain the underlying grain microstructures. With the propagation of the consistency constraint, the proposed method can automatically match grain segments between slices. On each of the 2D image slices, stable structures identified from the previous slice can be well-preserved, with further refinement by clustering the pixels in terms of both intensity and spatial information. We tested the proposed algorithm on a 3D superalloy image consisting of 170 2D slices. Performance is evaluated against manually annotated ground-truth segmentation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art 2D, 3D, and propagation-based segmentation methods in terms of both segmentation accuracy and running time.

    * Abstract: This paper advances descriptor-based face recognition by suggesting a novel usage of descriptors to form an over-complete representation, and by proposing a new metric learning pipeline within the same/not-same framework. First, the Over-Complete Local Binary Patterns (OCLBP) face representation scheme is introduced as a multi-scale modified version of the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) scheme. Second, we propose an efficient matrix-vector multiplication-based recognition system. The system is based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) coupled with Within Class Covariance Normalization (WCCN). This is further extended to the unsupervised case by proposing an unsupervised variant of WCCN. Lastly, we introduce Diffusion Maps (DM) for non-linear dimensionality reduction as an alternative to the Whitened Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) method which is often used in face recognition. We evaluate the proposed framework on the LFW face recognition dataset under the restricted, unrestricted and unsupervised protocols. In all three cases we achieve very competitive results.

    * Abstract: How do you tell a blackbird from a crow? There has been great progress toward automatic methods for visual recognition, including fine-grained visual categorization in which the classes to be distinguished are very similar. In a task such as bird species recognition, automatic recognition systems can now exceed the performance of non-experts most people are challenged to name a couple dozen bird species, let alone identify them. This leads us to the question, "Can a recognition system show humans what to look for when identifying classes (in this case birds)?" In the context of fine-grained visual categorization, we show that we can automatically determine which classes are most visually similar, discover what visual features distinguish very similar classes, and illustrate the key features in a way meaningful to humans. Running these methods on a dataset of bird images, we can generate a visual field guide to birds which includes a tree of similarity that displays the similarity relations between all species, pages for each species showing the most similar other species, and pages for each pair of similar species illustrating their differences.

    * Authors: Avishek Chatterjee, Venu Madhav Govindu
    * Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient averaging of relative 3D rotations. Apart from having an interesting geometric structure, robust rotation averaging addresses the need for a good initialization for largescale optimization used in structure-from-motion pipelines. Such pipelines often use unstructured image datasets harvested from the internet thereby requiring an initialization method that is robust to outliers. Our approach works on the Lie group structure of 3D rotations and solves the problem of large-scale robust rotation averaging in two ways. Firstly, we use modern 1 optimizers to carry out robust averaging of relative rotations that is efficient, scalable and robust to outliers. In addition, we also develop a twostep method that uses the 1 solution as an initialisation for an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. These methods achieve excellent results on large-scale, real world datasets and significantly outperform existing methods, i.e. the state-of-the-art discrete-continuous optimization method of [3] as well as the Weiszfeld method of [8]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two largescale real world datasets and also provide the results of the two aforementioned methods for comparison.

    * Abstract: The problem of minimizing the Potts energy function frequently occurs in computer vision applications. One way to tackle this NP-hard problem was proposed by Kovtun [20, 21]. It identifies a part of an optimal solution by running k maxflow computations, where k is the number of labels. The number of "labeled" pixels can be significant in some applications, e.g. 50-93% in our tests for stereo. We show how to reduce the runtime to O(log k) maxflow computations (or one parametric maxflow computation). Furthermore, the output of our algorithm allows to speed-up the subsequent alpha expansion for the unlabeled part, or can be used as it is for time-critical applications. To derive our technique, we generalize the algorithm of Felzenszwalb et al. [7] for Tree Metrics. We also show a connection to k-submodular functions from combinatorial optimization, and discuss k-submodular relaxations for general energy functions.

    * Authors: Tal Hassner
    * Abstract: We present a data-driven method for estimating the 3D shapes of faces viewed in single, unconstrained photos (aka "in-the-wild"). Our method was designed with an emphasis on robustness and efficiency with the explicit goal of deployment in real-world applications which reconstruct and display faces in 3D. Our key observation is that for many practical applications, warping the shape of a reference face to match the appearance of a query, is enough to produce realistic impressions of the query's 3D shape. Doing so, however, requires matching visual features between the (possibly very different) query and reference images, while ensuring that a plausible face shape is produced. To this end, we describe an optimization process which seeks to maximize the similarity of appearances and depths, jointly, to those of a reference model. We describe our system for monocular face shape reconstruction and present both qualitative and quantitative experiments, comparing our method against alternative systems, and demonstrating its capabilities. Finally, as a testament to its suitability for real-world applications, we offer an open, online implementation of our system, providing unique means of instant 3D viewing of faces appearing in web photos.

    * Publication Date: `2013`
    * Authors: Suyog Dutt Jain, Kristen Grauman
    * Abstract: The mode of manual annotation used in an interactive segmentation algorithm affects both its accuracy and easeof-use. For example, bounding boxes are fast to supply, yet may be too coarse to get good results on difficult images; freehand outlines are slower to supply and more specific, yet they may be overkill for simple images. Whereas existing methods assume a fixed form of input no matter the image, we propose to predict the tradeoff between accuracy and effort. Our approach learns whether a graph cuts segmentation will succeed if initialized with a given annotation mode, based on the image's visual separability and foreground uncertainty. Using these predictions, we optimize the mode of input requested on new images a user wants segmented. Whether given a single image that should be segmented as quickly as possible, or a batch of images that must be segmented within a specified time budget, we show how to select the easiest modality that will be sufficiently strong to yield high quality segmentations. Extensive results with real users and three datasets demonstrate the impact.

    * Abstract: Recognition of gesture sequences is in general a very difficult problem, but in certain domains the difficulty may be mitigated by exploiting the domain's "grammar". One such grammatically constrained gesture sequence domain is sign language. In this paper we investigate the case of fingerspelling recognition, which can be very challenging due to the quick, small motions of the fingers. Most prior work on this task has assumed a closed vocabulary of fingerspelled words; here we study the more natural open-vocabulary case, where the only domain knowledge is the possible fingerspelled letters and statistics of their sequences. We develop a semi-Markov conditional model approach, where feature functions are defined over segments of video and their corresponding letter labels. We use classifiers of letters and linguistic handshape features, along with expected motion profiles, to define segmental feature functions. This approach improves letter error rate (Levenshtein distance between hypothesized and correct letter sequences) from 16.3% using a hidden Markov model baseline to 11.6% using the proposed semi-Markov model.

    * Abstract: Egocentric cameras can be used to benefit such tasks as analyzing fine motor skills, recognizing gestures and learning about hand-object manipulation. To enable such technology, we believe that the hands must detected on the pixellevel to gain important information about the shape of the hands and fingers. We show that the problem of pixel-wise hand detection can be effectively solved, by posing the problem as a model recommendation task. As such, the goal of a recommendation system is to recommend the n-best hand detectors based on the probe set a small amount of labeled data from the test distribution. This requirement of a probe set is a serious limitation in many applications, such as ego-centric hand detection, where the test distribution may be continually changing. To address this limitation, we propose the use of virtual probes which can be automatically extracted from the test distribution. The key idea is that many features, such as the color distribution or relative performance between two detectors, can be used as a proxy to the probe set. In our experiments we show that the recommendation paradigm is well-equipped to handle complex changes in the appearance of the hands in firstperson vision. In particular, we show how our system is able to generalize to new scenarios by testing our model across multiple users.

    * Abstract: This paper addresses real-world challenges in the motion segmentation problem, including perspective effects, missing data, and unknown number of motions. It first formulates the 3-D motion segmentation from two perspective views as a subspace clustering problem, utilizing the epipolar constraint of an image pair. It then combines the point correspondence information across multiple image frames via a collaborative clustering step, in which tight integration is achieved via a mixed norm optimization scheme. For model selection, we propose an over-segment and merge approach, where the merging step is based on the property of the 1 -norm of the mutual sparse representation of two oversegmented groups. The resulting algorithm can deal with incomplete trajectories and perspective effects substantially better than state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods. Experiments on a 62-clip dataset show the significant superiority of the proposed idea in both segmentation accuracy and model selection.

The first level comprises the root space-time segments that may contain a human body. The second level comprises multi-grained space-time segments that contain parts of the root. We present an unsupervised method to generate this representation from video, which extracts both static and non-static relevant space-time segments, and also preserves their hierarchical and temporal relationships. Using simple linear SVM on the resultant bag of hierarchical space-time segments representation, we attain better than, or comparable to, state-of-the-art action recognition performance on two challenging benchmark datasets and at the same time produce good action localization results.

    * Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.

    * Abstract: We propose a novel parametrization of the data association problem for multi-target tracking. In our formulation, the number of targets is implicitly inferred together with the data association, effectively solving data association and model selection as a single inference problem. The novel formulation allows us to interpret data association and tracking as a single Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). We compute an approximate posterior solution to this problem using a dynamic programming/message passing technique. This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the tracking system. In particular, we incorporate inference over inliers/outliers and track termination times into the system. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate results competitive with, and in some cases exceeding the state of the art.

    * Authors: Shuran Song, Jianxiong Xiao
    * Abstract: Despite significant progress, tracking is still considered to be a very challenging task. Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily. This may be a game changer for tracking, since depth can be used to prevent model drift and handle occlusion. We also observe that current tracking algorithms are mostly evaluated on a very small number of videos collected and annotated by different groups. The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input. We aim to lay the foundation for further research in both RGB and RGBD tracking, and our benchmark is available at http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu.

    * Authors: Christoph Vogel, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth
    * Abstract: Estimating dense 3D scene flow from stereo sequences remains a challenging task, despite much progress in both classical disparity and 2D optical flow estimation. To overcome the limitations of existing techniques, we introduce a novel model that represents the dynamic 3D scene by a collection of planar, rigidly moving, local segments. Scene flow estimation then amounts to jointly estimating the pixelto-segment assignment, and the 3D position, normal vector, and rigid motion parameters of a plane for each segment. The proposed energy combines an occlusion-sensitive data term with appropriate shape, motion, and segmentation regularizers. Optimization proceeds in two stages: Starting from an initial superpixelization, we estimate the shape and motion parameters of all segments by assigning a proposal from a set of moving planes. Then the pixel-to-segment assignment is updated, while holding the shape and motion parameters of the moving planes fixed. We demonstrate the benefits of our model on different real-world image sets, including the challenging KITTI benchmark. We achieve leading performance levels, exceeding competing 3D scene flow methods, and even yielding better 2D motion estimates than all tested dedicated optical flow techniques.

    * Abstract: Existing scene understanding datasets contain only a limited set of views of a place, and they lack representations of complete 3D spaces. In this paper, we introduce SUN3D, a large-scale RGB-D video database with camera pose and object labels, capturing the full 3D extent of many places. The tasks that go into constructing such a dataset are difficult in isolation hand-labeling videos is painstaking, and structure from motion (SfM) is unreliable for large spaces. But if we combine them together, we make the dataset construction task much easier. First, we introduce an intuitive labeling tool that uses a partial reconstruction to propagate labels from one frame to another. Then we use the object labels to fix errors in the reconstruction. For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences. This algorithm works by constraining points for the same object from different frames to lie inside a fixed-size bounding box, parameterized by its rotation and translation. The SUN3D database, the source code for the generalized bundle adjustment, and the web-based 3D annotation tool are all available at http://sun3d.cs.princeton.edu.

    * Abstract: Human action recognition under low observational latency is receiving a growing interest in computer vision due to rapidly developing technologies in human-robot interaction, computer gaming and surveillance. In this paper we propose a fast, simple, yet powerful non-parametric Moving Pose (MP) framework for low-latency human action and activity recognition. Central to our methodology is a moving pose descriptor that considers both pose information as well as differential quantities (speed and acceleration) of the human body joints within a short time window around the current frame. The proposed descriptor is used in conjunction with a modified kNN classifier that considers both the temporal location of a particular frame within the action sequence as well as the discrimination power of its moving pose descriptor compared to other frames in the training set. The resulting method is non-parametric and enables low-latency recognition, one-shot learning, and action detection in difficult unsegmented sequences. Moreover, the framework is real-time, scalable, and outperforms more sophisticated approaches on challenging benchmarks like MSR-Action3D or MSR-DailyActivities3D.

    * Abstract: We address the problem of wide-baseline registration of RGB-D data, such as photo-textured laser scans without any artificial targets or prediction on the relative motion. Our approach allows to fully automatically register scans taken in GPS-denied environments such as urban canyon, industrial facilities or even indoors. We build upon image features which are plenty, localized well and much more discriminative than geometry features; however, they suffer from viewpoint distortions and request for normalization. We utilize the principle of salient directions present in the geometry and propose to extract (several) directions from the distribution of surface normals or other cues such as observable symmetries. Compared to previous work we pose no requirements on the scanned scene (like containing large textured planes) and can handle arbitrary surface shapes. Rendering the whole scene from these repeatable directions using an orthographic camera generates textures which are identical up to 2D similarity transformations. This ambiguity is naturally handled by 2D features and allows to find stable correspondences among scans. For geometric pose estimation from tentative matches we propose a fast and robust 2 point sample consensus scheme integrating an early rejection phase. We evaluate our approach on different challenging real world scenes.

Range data produced by commodity handheld cameras suffers from high-frequency errors and low-frequency distortion. Our approach deals with both sources of error by reconstructing locally smooth scene fragments and letting these fragments deform in order to align to each other. We develop a volumetric registration formulation that leverages the smoothness of the deformation to make optimization practical for large scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases the fidelity of complex scene geometry reconstructed with commodity handheld cameras.

    * Authors: Wongun Choi
    * Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two key aspects of multiple target tracking problem: 1) designing an accurate affinity measure to associate detections and 2) implementing an efficient and accurate (near) online multiple target tracking algorithm. As for the first contribution, we introduce a novel Aggregated Local Flow Descriptor (ALFD) that encodes the relative motion pattern between a pair of temporally distant detections using long term interest point trajectories (IPTs). Leveraging on the IPTs, the ALFD provides a robust affinity measure for estimating the likelihood of matching detections regardless of the application scenarios. As for another contribution, we present a Near-Online Multi-target Tracking (NOMT) algorithm. The tracking problem is formulated as a data-association between targets and detections in a temporal window, that is performed repeatedly at every frame. While being efficient, NOMT achieves robustness via integrating multiple cues including ALFD metric, target dynamics, appearance similarity, and long term trajectory regularization into the model. Our ablative analysis verifies the superiority of the ALFD metric over the other conventional affinity metrics. We run a comprehensive experimental evaluation on two challenging tracking datasets, KITTI and MOT datasets. The NOMT method combined with ALFD metric achieves the best accuracy in both datasets with significant margins (about 10% higher MOTA) over the state-of-the-art.

    * Authors: Zhaopeng Cui, Ping Tan
    * Abstract: Global structure-from-motion (SfM) methods solve all cameras simultaneously from all available relative motions. It has better potential in both reconstruction accuracy and computation efficiency than incremental methods. However, global SfM is challenging, mainly because of two reasons. Firstly, translation averaging is difficult, since an essential matrix only tells the direction of relative translation. Secondly, it is also hard to filter out bad essential matrices due to feature matching failures. We propose to compute a sparse depth image at each camera to solve both problems. Depth images help to upgrade an essential matrix to a similarity transformation, which can determine the scale of relative translation. Thus, camera registration is formulated as a well-posed similarity averaging problem. Depth images also make the filtering of essential matrices simple and effective. In this way, translation averaging can be solved robustly in two convex L1 optimization problems, which reach the global optimum rapidly. We demonstrate this method in various examples including sequential data, Internet data, and ambiguous data with repetitive scene structures.

    * Abstract: Performance characterization of stereo methods is mandatory to decide which algorithm is useful for which application. Prevalent benchmarks mainly use the root mean squared error (RMS) with respect to ground truth disparity maps to quantify algorithm performance. We show that the RMS is of limited expressiveness for algorithm selection and introduce the HCI Stereo Metrics. These metrics assess stereo results by harnessing three semantic cues: depth discontinuities, planar surfaces, and fine geometric structures. For each cue, we extract the relevant set of pixels from existing ground truth. We then apply our evaluation functions to quantify characteristics such as edge fattening and surface smoothness. We demonstrate that our approach supports practitioners in selecting the most suitable algorithm for their application. Using the new Middlebury dataset, we show that rankings based on our metrics reveal specific algorithm strengths and weaknesses which are not quantified by existing metrics. We finally show how stacked bar charts and radar charts visually support multidimensional performance evaluation. An interactive stereo benchmark based on the proposed metrics and visualizations is available at: http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/stereometrics

    * Abstract: Object proposals have recently fueled the progress in detection performance. These proposals aim to provide category-agnostic localizations for all objects in an image. One way to generate proposals is to perform parametric min-cuts over seed locations. This paper demonstrates that standard parametric-cut models are ineffective in obtaining medium-sized objects, which we refer to as the middle child problem. We propose a new energy minimization framework incorporating geodesic distances between segments which solves this problem. In addition, we introduce a new superpixel merging algorithm which can generate a small set of seeds that reliably cover a large number of objects of all sizes. We call our method POISE--- "Proposals for Objects from Improved Seeds and Energies." POISE enables parametric min-cuts to reach their full potential. On PASCAL VOC it generates 2,640 segments with an average overlap of 0.81, whereas the closest competing methods require more than 4,200 proposals to reach the same accuracy. We show detailed quantitative comparisons against 5 state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL VOC and Microsoft COCO segmentation challenges.

We achieve this by leveraging the illumination variations captured in Internet photo-collections. In order to depict and characterize the illumination spectrum of a scene, our method relies on building discrete representations of the image appearance space through connectivity graphs defined over a pairwise image distance function. The smooth appearance transitions are found as the shortest path in the similarity graph among images, and robust image alignment is achieved by leveraging scene semantics, multi-view geometry, and image warping techniques. The attained results present an insightful and compact visualization of the scene illuminations captured in crowd-sourced imagery.

    * Abstract: For the segmentation of moving objects in videos, the analysis of long-term point trajectories has been very popular recently. In this paper, we formulate the segmentation of a video sequence based on point trajectories as a minimum cost multicut problem. Unlike the commonly used spectral clustering formulation, the minimum cost multicut formulation gives natural rise to optimize not only for a cluster assignment but also for the number of clusters while allowing for varying cluster sizes. In this setup, we provide a method to create a long-term point trajectory graph with attractive and repulsive binary terms and outperform state-of-the-art methods based on spectral clustering on the FBMS-59 dataset and on the motion subtask of the VSB100 dataset.

    * Abstract: We present a system which can recognize the contents of your meal from a single image, and then predict its nutritional contents, such as calories. The simplest version assumes that the user is eating at a restaurant for which we know the menu. In this case, we can collect images offline to train a multi-label classifier. At run time, we apply the classifier (running on your phone) to predict which foods are present in your meal, and we lookup the corresponding nutritional facts. We apply this method to a new dataset of images from 23 different restaurants, using a CNN-based classifier, significantly outperforming previous work. The more challenging setting works outside of restaurants. In this case, we need to estimate the size of the foods, as well as their labels. This requires solving segmentation and depth / volume estimation from a single image. We present CNN-based approaches to these problems, with promising preliminary results.

    * Abstract: The prospect of neural reconstruction from Electron Microscopy (EM) images has been elucidated by the automatic segmentation algorithms. Although segmentation algorithms eliminate the necessity of tracing the neurons by hand, significant manual effort is still essential for correcting the mistakes they make. A considerable amount of human labor is also required for annotating groundtruth volumes for training the classifiers of a segmentation framework. It is critically important to diminish the dependence on human interaction in the overall reconstruction system. This study proposes a novel classifier training algorithm for EM segmentation aimed to reduce the amount of manual effort demanded by the groundtruth annotation and error refinement tasks. Instead of using an exhaustive pixel level groundtruth, an active learning algorithm is proposed for sparse labeling of pixel and boundaries of superpixels. Because over-segmentation errors are in general more tolerable and easier to correct than the under-segmentation errors, our algorithm is designed to prioritize minimization of false-merges over false-split mistakes. Our experiments on both 2D and 3D data suggest that the proposed method yields segmentation outputs that are more amenable to neural reconstruction than those of existing methods.

    * Abstract: Object recognition approaches have recently been extended to yield, aside of the object class output, also viewpoint or pose. Training such approaches typically requires additional viewpoint or keypoint annotation in the training data or, alternatively, synthetic CAD models. In this paper,we present an approach that creates a dataset of images annotated with bounding boxes and viewpoint labels in a fully automated manner from videos. We assume that the scene is static in order to reconstruct 3D surfaces via structure from motion. We automatically detect when the reconstruction fails and normalize for the viewpoint of the 3D models by aligning the reconstructed point clouds. Exemplarily for cars we show that we can expand a large dataset of annotated single images and obtain improved performance when training a viewpoint regressor on this joined dataset.

    * Abstract: Recent advances have enabled 3d object reconstruction approaches using a single off-the-shelf RGB-D camera. Although these approaches are successful for a wide range of object classes, they rely on stable and distinctive geometric or texture features. Many objects like mechanical parts, toys, household or decorative articles, however, are textureless and characterized by minimalistic shapes that are simple and symmetric. Existing in-hand scanning systems and 3d reconstruction techniques fail for such symmetric objects in the absence of highly distinctive features. In this work, we show that extracting 3d hand motion for in-hand scanning effectively facilitates the reconstruction of even featureless and highly symmetric objects and we present an approach that fuses the rich additional information of hands into a 3d reconstruction pipeline, significantly contributing to the state-of-the-art of in-hand scanning.

    * Abstract: Test data plays an important role in computer vision (CV) but is plagued by two questions: Which situations should be covered by the test data and have we tested enough to reach a conclusion? In this paper we propose a new solution answering these questions using a standard procedure devised by the safety community to validate complex systems: The Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP). It is designed to systematically search and identify difficult, performance-decreasing situations and aspects. We introduce a generic CV model that creates the basis for the hazard analysis and, for the first time, apply an extensive HAZOP to the CV domain. The result is a publicly available checklist with more than 900 identified individual hazards. This checklist can be used to evaluate existing test datasets by quantifying the amount of covered hazards. We evaluate our approach by first analyzing and annotating the popular stereo vision test datasets Middlebury and KITTI. Second, we compare the performance of six popular stereo matching algorithms at the identified hazards from our checklist with their average performance and show, as expected, a clear negative influence of the hazards. The presented approach is a useful tool to evaluate and improve test datasets and creates a common basis for future dataset designs.

    * Abstract: Food recognition is an emerging computer vision topic. The problem is characterized by the absence of rigid structure of the food and by the large intra-class variations. Existing approaches tackle the problem by designing ad-hoc feature representations based on a priori knowledge of the problem. Differently from these, we propose a committee-based recognition system that chooses the optimal features out of the existing plethora of available ones (e.g., color, texture, etc.). Each committee member is an Extreme Learning Machine trained to classify food plates on the basis of a single feature type. Single member classifications are then considered by a structural Support Vector Machine to produce the final ranking of possible matches. This is achieved by filtering out the irrelevant features/classifiers, thus considering only the relevant ones. Experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art works on the most used three publicly available benchmark datasets.

We use Bezier patches to model leaf surface, which we compute from images and point clouds of dense foliage. We present an algorithm to segment individual leaves from colour and depth data. We then reconstruct the Bezier representation from segmented leaf points clouds using non-linear optimisation. Unlike previous work, we do not require laboratory scanned exemplars or user intervention. We also demonstrate intuitive manipulators to edit the reconstructed parametric models. We believe our work is a step towards making captured data more accessible to artists for foliage modelling.

    * Abstract: Many spectral clustering algorithms have been proposed and successfully applied to image data analysis such as content based image retrieval, image annotation, and image indexing. Conventional spectral clustering algorithms usually involve a two-stage process: eigendecomposition of similarity matrix and clustering assignments from eigenvectors by k-means or spectral rotation. However, the final clustering assignments obtained by the two-stage process may deviate from the assignments by directly optimize the original objective function. Moreover, most of these methods usually have very high computational complexities. In this paper, we propose a new min-cut algorithm for image clustering, which scales linearly to the data size. In the new method, a self-balanced min-cut model is proposed in which the Exclusive Lasso is implicitly introduced as a balance regularizer in order to produce balanced partition. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve the new model, which has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of samples. Theoretical analysis reveals that the new method can simultaneously minimize the graph cut and balance the partition across all clusters. A series of experiments were conducted on both synthetic and benchmark data sets and the experimental results show the superior performance of the new method.

    * Abstract: Scene text recognition has been a hot research topic in computer vision due to its various applications. The state of the art is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns the mapping between input images and output sequences in a purely data-driven way. However, we observe that existing attention-based methods perform poorly on complicated and/or low-quality images. One major reason is that existing methods cannot get accurate alignments between feature areas and targets for such images. We call this phenomenon "attention drift". To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose the FAN (the abbreviation of Focusing Attention Network) method that employs a focusing attention mechanism to automatically draw back the drifted attention. FAN consists of two major components: an attention network (AN) that is responsible for recognizing character targets as in the existing methods, and a focusing network (FN) that is responsible for adjusting attention by evaluating whether AN pays attention properly on the target areas in the images. Furthermore, different from the existing methods, we adopt a ResNet-based network to enrich deep representations of scene text images. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that the FAN method substantially outperforms the existing methods.

    * Abstract: Unsupervised learning from visual data is one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision. It is essential for understanding how visual recognition works. Learning from unsupervised input has an immense practical value, as huge quantities of unlabeled videos can be collected at low cost. Here we address the task of unsupervised learning to detect and segment foreground objects in single images. We achieve our goal by training a student pathway, consisting of a deep neural network that learns to predict, from a single input image, the output of a teacher pathway that performs unsupervised object discovery in video. Our approach is different from the published methods that perform unsupervised discovery in videos or in collections of images at test time. We move the unsupervised discovery phase during the training stage, while at test time we apply the standard feed-forward processing along the student pathway. This has a dual benefit: firstly, it allows, in principle, unlimited generalization possibilities during training, while remaining fast at testing. Secondly, the student not only becomes able to detect in single images significantly better than its unsupervised video discovery teacher, but it also achieves state of the art results on two current benchmarks, YouTube Objects and Object Discovery datasets. At test time, our system is two orders of magnitude faster than other previous methods.

    * Abstract: Real-time scene understanding has become crucial in many applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture, called BlitzNet, that jointly performs object detection and semantic segmentation in one forward pass, allowing real-time computations. Besides the computational gain of having a single network to perform several tasks, we show that object detection and semantic segmentation benefit from each other in terms of accuracy. Experimental results for VOC and COCO datasets show state-of-the-art performance for object detection and segmentation among real time systems.

    * Authors: Dong Gong, Mingkui Tan, Yanning Zhang, Anton van den Hengel, Qinfeng Shi
    * Abstract: The challenge in blind image deblurring is to remove the effects of blur with limited prior information about the nature of the blur process. Existing methods often assume that the blur image is produced by linear convolution with additive Gaussian noise. However, including even a small number of outliers to this model in the kernel estimation process can significantly reduce the resulting image quality. Previous methods mainly rely on some simple but unreliable heuristics to identify outliers for kernel estimation. Rather than attempt to identify outliers to the model a priori, we instead propose to sequentially identify inliers, and gradually incorporate them into the estimation process. The self-paced kernel estimation scheme we propose represents a generalization of existing self-paced learning approaches, in which we gradually detect and include reliable inlier pixel sets in a blurred image for kernel estimation. Moreover, we automatically activate a subset of significant gradients w.r.t. the reliable inlier pixels, and then update the intermediate sharp image and the kernel accordingly. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images with various kinds of outliers demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    * Authors: Wenhao He, Xu-Yao Zhang, Fei Yin, Cheng-Lin Liu
    * Abstract: In this paper, we first provide a new perspective to divide existing high performance object detection methods into direct and indirect regressions. Direct regression performs boundary regression by predicting the offsets from a given point, while indirect regression predicts the offsets from some bounding box proposals. In the context of multi-oriented scene text detection, we analyze the drawbacks of indirect regression, which covers the state-of-the-art detection structures Faster-RCNN and SSD as instances, and point out the potential superiority of direct regression. To verify this point of view, we propose a deep direct regression based method for multi-oriented scene text detection. Our detection framework is simple and effective with a fully convolutional network and one-step post processing. The fully convolutional network is optimized in an end-to-end way and has bi-task outputs where one is pixel-wise classification between text and non-text, and the other is direct regression to determine the vertex coordinates of quadrilateral text boundaries. The proposed method is particularly beneficial to localize incidental scene texts. On the ICDAR2015 Incidental Scene Text benchmark, our method achieves the F-measure of 81%, which is a new state-of-the-art and significantly outperforms previous approaches. On other standard datasets with focused scene texts, our method also reaches the state-of-the-art performance.

    * Authors: Pan He, Weilin Huang, Tong He, Qile Zhu, Yu Qiao, Xiaolin Li
    * Abstract: We present a novel single-shot text detector that directly outputs word-level bounding boxes in a natural image. We propose an attention mechanism which roughly identifies text regions via an automatically learned attentional map. This substantially suppresses background interference in the convolutional features, which is the key to producing accurate inference of words, particularly at extremely small sizes. This results in a single model that essentially works in a coarse-to-fine manner. It departs from recent FCN-based text detectors which cascade multiple FCN models to achieve an accurate prediction. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical inception module which efficiently aggregates multi-scale inception features. This enhances local details, and also encodes strong context information, allowing the detector to work reliably on multi-scale and multi-orientation text with single-scale images. Our text detector achieves an F-measure of 77% on the ICDAR 2015 benchmark, advancing the state-of-the-art results.

    * Authors: Margret Keuper
    * Abstract: Most state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms draw their potential from modeling motion differences of local entities such as point trajectories in terms of pairwise potentials in graphical models. Inference in instances of minimum cost multicut problems defined on such graphs allows to optimize the number of the resulting segments along with the segment assignment. However, pairwise potentials limit the discriminative power of the employed motion models to translational differences. More complex models such as Euclidean or affine transformations call for higher-order potentials and a tractable inference in the resulting higher-order graphical models. In this paper, we (1) introduce a generalization of the minimum cost lifted multicut problem to hypergraphs, and (2) propose a simple primal feasible heuristic that allows for a reasonably efficient inference in instances of higher-order lifted multicut problem instances defined on point trajectory hypergraphs for motion segmentation. The resulting motion segmentations improve over the state-of-the-art on the FBMS-59 dataset.

    * Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of room layout estimation from a monocular RGB image. Prior works break the problem into two sub-tasks: semantic segmentation of floor, walls, ceiling to produce layout hypotheses, followed by an iterative optimization step to rank these hypotheses. In contrast, we adopt a more direct formulation of this problem as one of estimating an ordered set of room layout keypoints. The room layout and the corresponding segmentation is completely specified given the locations of these ordered keypoints. We predict the locations of the room layout keypoints using RoomNet, an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder network. On the challenging benchmark datasets Hedau and LSUN, we achieve state-of-the-art performance along with 200x to 600x speedup compared to the most recent work. Additionally, we present optional extensions to the RoomNet architecture such as including recurrent computations and memory units to refine the keypoint locations under the same parametric capacity.

    * Abstract: In this work, we jointly address the problem of text detection and recognition in natural scene images based on convolutional recurrent neural networks. We propose a unified network that simultaneously localizes and recognizes text with a single forward pass, avoiding intermediate processes, such as image cropping, feature re-calculation, word separation, and character grouping. In contrast to existing approaches that consider text detection and recognition as two distinct tasks and tackle them one by one, the proposed framework settles these two tasks concurrently. The whole framework can be trained end-to-end, requiring only images, ground-truth bounding boxes and text labels. The convolutional features are calculated only once and shared by both detection and recognition, which saves processing time. Through multi-task training, the learned features become more informative and improves the overall performance. Our proposed method has achieved competitive performance on several benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: Cinemagraphs are a compelling way to convey dynamic aspects of a scene. In these media, dynamic and still elements are juxtaposed to create an artistic and narrative experience. Creating a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing cinemagraph requires isolating objects in a semantically meaningful way and then selecting good start times and looping periods for those objects to minimize visual artifacts (such a tearing). To achieve this, we present a new technique that uses object recognition and semantic segmentation as part of an optimization method to automatically create cinemagraphs from videos that are both visually appealing and semantically meaningful. Given a scene with multiple objects, there are many cinemagraphs one could create. Our method evaluates these multiple candidates and presents the best one, as determined by a model trained to predict human preferences in a collaborative way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with multiple results and a user study.

    * Abstract: RGBD semantic segmentation requires joint reasoning about 2D appearance and 3D geometric information. In this paper we propose a 3D graph neural network (3DGNN) that builds a k-nearest neighbor graph on top of 3D point cloud. Each node in the graph corresponds to a set of points and is associated with a hidden representation vector initialized with an appearance feature extracted by a unary CNN from 2D images. Relying on recurrent functions, every node dynamically updates its hidden representation based on the current status and incoming messages from its neighbors. This propagation model is unrolled for a certain number of time steps and the final per-node representation is used for predicting the semantic class of each pixel. We use back-propagation through time to train the model. Extensive experiments on NYUD2 and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    * Authors: Mahdi Rad, Vincent Lepetit
    * Abstract: We introduce a novel method for 3D object detection and pose estimation from color images only. We first use segmentation to detect the objects of interest in 2D even in presence of partial occlusions and cluttered background. By contrast with recent patch-based methods, we rely on a "holistic" approach: We apply to the detected objects a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to predict their 3D poses in the form of 2D projections of the corners of their 3D bounding boxes. This, however, is not sufficient for handling objects from the recent T-LESS dataset: These objects exhibit an axis of rotational symmetry, and the similarity of two images of such an object under two different poses makes training the CNN challenging. We solve this problem by restricting the range of poses used for training, and by introducing a classifier to identify the range of a pose at run-time before estimating it. We also use an optional additional step that refines the predicted poses. We improve the state-of-the-art on the LINEMOD dataset from 73.7% to 89.3% of correctly registered RGB frames. We are also the first to report results on the Occlusion dataset using color images only. We obtain 54% of frames passing the Pose 6D criterion on average on several sequences of the T-LESS dataset, compared to the 67% of the state-of-the-art on the same sequences which uses both color and depth. The full approach is also scalable, as a single network can be trained for multiple objects simultaneously.

    * Abstract: Lineage tracing, the joint segmentation and tracking of living cells as they move and divide in a sequence of light microscopy images, is a challenging task. Jug et al. have proposed a mathematical abstraction of this task, the moral lineage tracing problem (MLTP), whose feasible solutions define both a segmentation of every image and a lineage forest of cells. Their branch-and-cut algorithm, however, is prone to many cuts and slow convergence for large instances. To address this problem, we make three contributions: (i) we devise the first efficient primal feasible local search algorithms for the MLTP, (ii) we improve the branch-and-cut algorithm by separating tighter cutting planes and by incorporating our primal algorithms, (iii) we show in experiments that our algorithms find accurate solutions on the problem instances of Jug et al. and scale to larger instances, leveraging moral lineage tracing to practical significance.

We make the following contributions: i) we extend previous medial point detection methods for color images, by associating each medial point with a local scale; ii) inspired by the invertibility property of the binary MAT, we also associate each medial point with a local encoding that allows us to invert the AMAT, reconstructing the input image; iii) we describe a clustering scheme that takes advantage of the additional scale and appearance information to group individual points into medial branches, providing a shape decomposition of the underlying image regions. In our experiments, we show state-of-the-art performance in medial point detection on Berkeley Medial AXes (BMAX500), a new dataset of medial axes based on the BSDS500 database, and good generalization on the SK506 and WH-SYMMAX datasets. We also measure the quality of reconstructed images from BMAX500, obtained by inverting their computed AMAT. Our approach delivers significantly better reconstruction quality wrt to three baselines, using just 10% of the image pixels.

    * Abstract: Blob detection and image denoising are fundamental, and sometimes related, tasks in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a blob reconstruction method using scale-invariant normalized unilateral second order Gaussian kernels. Unlike other blob detection methods, our method suppresses non-blob structures while also identifying blob parameters, i.e., position, prominence and scale, thereby facilitating blob reconstruction. We present an algorithm for high-ISO long-exposure noise removal that results from the combination of our blob reconstruction method and state-of-the-art denoising methods, i.e., the non-local means algorithm (NLM) and the color version of block-matching and 3-D filtering (CBM3D). Experiments on standard images corrupted by real high-ISO long-exposure noise and real-world noisy images demonstrate that our schemes incorporating the blob reduction procedure outperform both the original NLM and CBM3D.

Our benchmark provides different perspectives of the world captured from airplanes, drones and cars driving around the city. Manually labeling such a large scale dataset is infeasible. Instead, we propose to utilize different sources of high-precision maps to create our ground truth. Towards this goal, we develop algorithms that allow us to align all data sources with the maps while requiring minimal human supervision. We have designed a wide variety of tasks including building height estimation (reconstruction), road centerline and curb extraction, building instance segmentation, building contour extraction (reorganization), semantic labeling and scene type classification (recognition). Our pilot study shows that most of these tasks are still difficult for modern convolutional neural networks.

    * Abstract: The optical microscope remains a widely-used tool for diagnosis and quantitation of malaria. An automated system that can match the performance of well-trained technicians is motivated by a shortage of trained microscopists. We have developed a computer vision system that leverages deep learning to identify malaria parasites in micrographs of standard, field-prepared thick blood films. The prototype application diagnoses P. falciparum with sufficient accuracy to achieve competency level 1 in the World Health Organization external competency assessment, and quantitates with sufficient accuracy for use in drug resistance studies. A suite of new computer vision techniques--global white balance, adaptive nonlinear grayscale, and a novel augmentation scheme--underpin the system's state-of-the-art performance. We outline a rich, global training set; describe the algorithm in detail; argue for patient-level performance metrics for the evaluation of automated diagnosis methods; and provide results for P. falciparum.

Such datasets are preva- lent in connectomics, where neuron segmentation needs to be performed across very large electron microscopy image volumes. We show the advantages of a hierarchical block- wise scheme over local stitching strategies and evaluate the performance of different Multicut solvers for the segmenta- tion of the blocks in the hierarchy. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm on a small fully annotated dataset (5x5x5 mm) and demonstrate no significant loss in segmentation quality compared to solving the Multicut problem globally. We evaluate the scalability of the algorithm on a 95x60x60 mm image volume and show that solving the Multicut prob- lem is no longer the bottleneck of the segmentation pipeline.

After a step of filtering, the estimated mobile objects are exploited in a model predictive control scheme for collision avoidance while tracking a reference trajectory. Experimental results with the complete loop are reported for a micro-air vehicle and a mobile robot in realistic situations, with everything computed on board.

    * Abstract: Reading text in the wild is gaining attention in the computer vision community. Images captured in the wild are almost always compressed to varying degrees, depending on application context, and this compression introduces artifacts that distort image content into the captured images. In this paper we investigate the impact these compression artifacts have on text localization and recognition in the wild. We also propose a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can eliminate text-specific compression artifacts and which leads to an improvement in text recognition. Experimental results on the ICDAR-Challenge4 dataset demonstrate that compression artifacts have a significant impact on text localization and recognition and that our approach yields an improvement in both -- especially at high compression rates.

    * Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of the effect of large scale video data augmentation for semantic segmentation in driving scenarios. Our work is motivated by a strong correlation between the high performance of most recent deep learning based methods and the availability of large volumes of ground truth labels. To generate additional labelled data, we make use of an occlusion-aware and uncertaintyenabled label propagation algorithm. As a result we increase the availability of high-resolution labelled frames by a factor of 20, yielding in a 6.8% to 10.8% rise in average classification accuracy and/or IoU scores for several semantic segmentation networks. Our key contributions include: (a) augmented CityScapes and CamVid datasets providing 56.2K and 6.5K additional labelled frames of object classes respectively, (b) detailed empirical analysis of the effect of the use of augmented data as well as (c) extension of proposed framework to instance segmentation.

    * Abstract: Although the importance of the Fourier phase to image perception has been addressed, it is unknown this is the case for texture similarity or not. We first show that phase is more important to human perceptual texture similarity than magnitude. We further test the ability of 51 feature sets to use phase for texture similarity. Yet it is found that magnitude is more important to these feature sets than phase. Considering the inconsistency between the similarity data obtained using humans and those feature sets, we attribute this to the difference in the ability of humans and these feature sets to use phase. Thus, we enable the 51 feature sets to use phase by fusing the features extracted from the original and phase-only images. It is shown that the fused feature sets yield better results than those derived using the 51 feature sets. In particular, this finding can also be propagated to CNN features. These promising results should be due to the importance of phase to texture similarity.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of sequentially building houses in the game of Minecraft, and demonstrate that learning the ordering can make for more effective autoregressive models. Given a partially built house made by a human player, our system tries to place additional blocks in a human-like manner to complete the house. We introduce a new dataset, HouseCraft, for this new task. HouseCraft contains the sequential order in which 2,500 Minecraft houses were built from scratch by humans. The human action sequences enable us to learn an order-aware generative model called Voxel-CNN. In contrast to many generative models where the sequential generation ordering either does not matter (e.g. holistic generation with GANs), or is manually/arbitrarily set by simple rules (e.g. raster-scan order), our focus is on an ordered generation that imitates humans. To evaluate if a generative model can accurately predict human-like actions, we propose several novel quantitative metrics. We demonstrate that our Voxel-CNN model is simple and effective at this creative task, and can serve as a strong baseline for future research in this direction. The HouseCraft dataset and code with baseline models will be made publicly available.

    * Abstract: We present a novel neural network architecture, termed Decomposer-Composer, for semantic structure-aware 3D shape modeling. Our method utilizes an auto-encoder-based pipeline, and produces a novel factorized shape embedding space, where the semantic structure of the shape collection translates into a data-dependent sub-space factorization, and where shape composition and decomposition become simple linear operations on the embedding coordinates. We further propose to model shape assembly using an explicit learned part deformation module, which utilizes a 3D spatial transformer network to perform an in-network volumetric grid deformation, and which allows us to train the whole system end-to-end. The resulting network allows us to perform part-level shape manipulation, unattainable by existing approaches. Our extensive ablation study, comparison to baseline methods and qualitative analysis demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: Most existing text spotting methods either focus on horizontal/oriented texts or perform arbitrary shaped text spotting with character-level annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel text spotting framework to detect and recognize text of arbitrary shapes in an end-to-end manner, using only word/line-level annotations for training. Motivated from the name of TextSnake, which is only a detection model, we call the proposed text spotting framework TextDragon. In TextDragon, a text detector is designed to describe the shape of text with a series of quadrangles, which can handle text of arbitrary shapes. To extract arbitrary text regions from feature maps, we propose a new differentiable operator named RoISlide, which is the key to connect arbitrary shaped text detection and recognition. Based on the extracted features through RoISlide, a CNN and CTC based text recognizer is introduced to make the framework free from labeling the location of characters. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two curved text benchmarks CTW1500 and Total-Text, and competitive results on the ICDAR 2015 Dataset.

    * Abstract: In this work, we present a new operator, called Instance Mask Projection (IMP), which projects a predicted instance segmentation as a new feature for semantic segmentation. It also supports back propagation and is trainable end-to end. By adding this operator, we introduce a new way to combine top-down and bottom-up information in semantic segmentation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of IMP on both clothing parsing (with complex layering, large deformations, and non-convex objects), and on street scene segmentation (with many overlapping instances and small objects). On the Varied Clothing Parsing dataset (VCP), we show instance mask projection can improve mIOU by 3 points over a state-of-the-art Panoptic FPN segmentation approach. On the ModaNet clothing parsing dataset, we show a dramatic improvement of 20.4% compared to existing baseline semantic segmentation results. In addition, the Instance Mask Projection operator works well on other (non-clothing) datasets, providing an improvement in mIOU of 3 points on "thing" classes of Cityscapes, a self-driving dataset, over a state-of-the-art approach.

    * Authors: Pedro Hermosilla,  Tobias Ritschel,  Timo Ropinski
    * Abstract: We show that denoising of 3D point clouds can be learned unsupervised, directly from noisy 3D point cloud data only. This is achieved by extending recent ideas from learning of unsupervised image denoisers to unstructured 3D point clouds. Unsupervised image denoisers operate under the assumption that a noisy pixel observation is a random realization of a distribution around a clean pixel value, which allows appropriate learning on this distribution to eventually converge to the correct value. Regrettably, this assumption is not valid for unstructured points: 3D point clouds are subject to total noise, i.e. deviations in all coordinates, with no reliable pixel grid. Thus, an observation can be the realization of an entire manifold of clean 3D points, which makes the quality of a naive extension of unsupervised image denoisers to 3D point clouds unfortunately only little better than mean filtering. To overcome this, and to enable effective and unsupervised 3D point cloud denoising, we introduce a spatial prior term, that steers converges to the unique closest out of the many possible modes on the manifold. Our results demonstrate unsupervised denoising performance similar to that of supervised learning with clean data when given enough training examples - whereby we do not need any pairs of noisy and clean training data.

    * Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are potentially short of the ability to learn hierarchical representation for graph embedding, which holds them back in the graph classification task. Here, we propose AttPool, which is a novel graph pooling module based on attention mechanism, to remedy the problem. It is able to select nodes that are significant for graph representation adaptively, and generate hierarchical features via aggregating the attention-weighted information in nodes. Additionally, we devise a hierarchical prediction architecture to sufficiently leverage the hierarchical representation and facilitate the model learning. The AttPool module together with the entire training structure can be integrated into existing GCNs, and is trained in an end-to-end fashion conveniently. The experimental results on several graph-classification benchmark datasets with various scales demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    * Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve impressive performance in a wide variety of fields. Their success benefited from a massive boost when very deep CNN models were able to be reliably trained. Despite their merits, CNNs fail to properly address problems with non-Euclidean data. To overcome this challenge, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build graphs to represent non-Euclidean data, borrow concepts from CNNs, and apply them in training. GCNs show promising results, but they are usually limited to very shallow models due to the vanishing gradient problem. As a result, most state-of-the-art GCN models are no deeper than 3 or 4 layers. In this work, we present new ways to successfully train very deep GCNs. We do this by borrowing concepts from CNNs, specifically residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapting them to GCN architectures. Extensive experiments show the positive effect of these deep GCN frameworks. Finally, we use these new concepts to build a very deep 56-layer GCN, and show how it significantly boosts performance (+3.7% mIoU over state-of-the-art) in the task of point cloud semantic segmentation. We believe that the community can greatly benefit from this work, as it opens up many opportunities for advancing GCN-based research.

    * Authors: Phuc Xuan Nguyen,  Deva Ramanan,  Charless C. Fowlkes
    * Abstract: We describe a latent approach that learns to detect actions in long sequences given training videos with only whole-video class labels. Our approach makes use of two innovations to attention-modeling in weakly-supervised learning. First, and most notably, our framework uses an attention model to extract both foreground and background frames who's appearance is explicitly modeled. Most prior work ignores the background, but we show that modeling it allows our system to learn a richer notions of actions and their temporal extents. Second, we combine bottom-up, class-agnostic attention modules with top-down, class-specific activation maps, using the latter as form of self-supervision for the former. Doing so allows our model to learn a more accurate model of attention without explicit temporal supervision. These modifications lead to 10% AP@IoU=0.5 improvement over existing systems on THUMOS14. Our proposed weakly-supervised system outperforms the recent state-of-the-art by at least 4.3% AP@IoU=0.5. Finally, we demonstrate that weakly-supervised learning can be used to aggressively scale-up learning to in-the-wild, uncurated Instagram videos (where relevant frames and videos are automatically selected through attentional processing). This allows our weakly supervised approach to even outperform fully-supervised methods for action detection at some overlap thresholds.

    * Abstract: We propose an end-to-end trainable network that can simultaneously detect and recognize text of arbitrary shape, making substantial progress on the open problem of reading scene text of irregular shape. We formulate arbitrary shape text detection as an instance segmentation problem; an attention model is then used to decode the textual content of each irregularly shaped text region without rectification. To extract useful irregularly shaped text instance features from image scale features, we propose a simple yet effective RoI masking step. Additionally, we show that predictions from an existing multi-step OCR engine can be leveraged as partially labeled training data, which leads to significant improvements in both the detection and recognition accuracy of our model. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art for end-to-end recognition tasks on the ICDAR15 (straight) benchmark by 4.6%, and on the Total-Text (curved) benchmark by more than 16%.

    * Abstract: Deep neural networks provide powerful tools for pattern recognition, while classical graph algorithms are widely used to solve combinatorial problems. In computer vision, many tasks combine elements of both pattern recognition and graph reasoning. In this paper, we study how to connect deep networks with graph decomposition into an end-to-end trainable framework. More specifically, the minimum cost multicut problem is first converted to an unconstrained binary cubic formulation where cycle consistency constraints are incorporated into the objective function. The new optimization problem can be viewed as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) in which the random variables are associated with the binary edge labels. Cycle constraints are introduced into the CRF as high-order potentials. A standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) provides the front-end features for the fully differentiable CRF. The parameters of both parts are optimized in an end-to-end manner. The efficacy of the proposed learning algorithm is demonstrated via experiments on clustering MNIST images and on the challenging task of real-world multi-people pose estimation.

    * Abstract: Racial bias is an important issue in biometric, but has not been thoroughly studied in deep face recognition. In this paper, we first contribute a dedicated dataset called Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) database, on which we firmly validated the racial bias of four commercial APIs and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Then, we further present the solution using deep unsupervised domain adaptation and propose a deep information maximization adaptation network (IMAN) to alleviate this bias by using Caucasian as source domain and other races as target domains. This unsupervised method simultaneously aligns global distribution to decrease race gap at domain-level, and learns the discriminative target representations at cluster level. A novel mutual information loss is proposed to further enhance the discriminative ability of network output without label information. Extensive experiments on RFW, GBU, and IJB-A databases show that IMAN successfully learns features that generalize well across different races and across different databases.

    * Abstract: Neural networks for image recognition have evolved through extensive manual design from simple chain-like models to structures with multiple wiring paths. The success of ResNets and DenseNets is due in large part to their innovative wiring plans. Now, neural architecture search (NAS) studies are exploring the joint optimization of wiring and operation types, however, the space of possible wirings is constrained and still driven by manual design despite being searched. In this paper, we explore a more diverse set of connectivity patterns through the lens of randomly wired neural networks. To do this, we first define the concept of a stochastic network generator that encapsulates the entire network generation process. Encapsulation provides a unified view of NAS and randomly wired networks. Then, we use three classical random graph models to generate randomly wired graphs for networks. The results are surprising: several variants of these random generators yield network instances that have competitive accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark. These results suggest that new efforts focusing on designing better network generators may lead to new breakthroughs by exploring less constrained search spaces with more room for novel design.

Our graph-theoretic formulation models the spatio-temporal relationships among our observations in terms of the joint estimation of their 3D geometry and its discrete Laplace operator. Towards this end, we define a tri-convex optimization framework that leverages the geometric properties and dependencies found among a Euclidean shape-space and the discrete Laplace operator describing its local and global topology. We present a reconstructability analysis, experiments on motion capture data and multi-view image datasets, as well as explore applications to geometry-based event segmentation and data association.

    * Abstract: We address scene layout modeling for recognizing agent-in-place actions, which are actions associated with agents who perform them and the places where they occur, in the context of outdoor home surveillance. We introduce a novel representation to model the geometry and topology of scene layouts so that a network can generalize from the layouts observed in the training scenes to unseen scenes in the test set. This Layout-Induced Video Representation (LIVR) abstracts away low-level appearance variance and encodes geometric and topological relationships of places to explicitly model scene layout. LIVR partitions the semantic features of a scene into different places to force the network to learn generic place-based feature descriptions which are independent of specific scene layouts; then, LIVR dynamically aggregates features based on connectivities of places in each specific scene to model its layout. We introduce a new Agent-in-Place Action (APA) dataset(The dataset is pending legal review and will be released upon the acceptance of this paper.) to show that our method allows neural network models to generalize significantly better to unseen scenes.

    * Abstract: Curvilinear structure segmentation (CSS) is under semantic segmentation, whose applications include crack detection, aerial road extraction, and biomedical image segmentation. In general, geometric topology and pixel-wise features are two critical aspects of CSS. However, most semantic segmentation methods only focus on enhancing feature representations while existing CSS techniques emphasize preserving topology alone. In this paper, we present a Joint Topology-preserving and Feature-refinement Network (JTFN) that jointly models global topology and refined features based on an iterative feedback learning strategy. Specifically, we explore the structure of objects to help preserve corresponding topologies of predicted masks, thus design a reciprocative two-stream module for CSS and boundary detection. In addition, we introduce such topology-aware predictions as feedback guidance that refines attentive features by supplementing and enhancing saliencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly addresses topology preserving and feature refinement for CSS. We evaluate JTFN on four datasets of diverse applications: Crack500, CrackTree200, Roads, and DRIVE. Results show that JTFN performs best in comparison with alternative methods. Code is available.

    * Abstract: Scene Graph Generators (SGGs) are models that, given an image, build a directed graph where each edge represents a predicted subject predicate object triplet. Most SGGs silently exploit datasets' bias on relationships' context, i.e. its subject and object, to improve recall and neglect spatial and visual evidence, e.g. having seen a glut of data for person wearing shirt, they are overconfident that every person is wearing every shirt. Such imprecise predictions are mainly ascribed to the lack of negative examples for most relationships, fact that obstructs models from meaningfully learning predicates, even those which have ample positive examples. We first present an in-depth investigation of the context bias issue to showcase that all examined state-of-the-art SGGs share the above vulnerabilities. In response, we propose a semi-supervised scheme that forces predicted triplets to be grounded consistently back to the image, in a closed-loop manner. The developed spatial common sense can be then distilled to a student SGG and substantially enhance its spatial reasoning ability. This Grounding Consistency Distillation (GCD) approach is model-agnostic and profits from the superfluous unlabeled samples to retain the valuable context information and avert memorization of annotations. Furthermore, we ascertain that current metrics disregard unlabeled samples, rendering themselves incapable of reflecting context bias, then we mine and incorporate during evaluation hard-negatives to reformulate precision as a reliable metric. Extensive experimental comparisons exhibit large quantitative - up to 70% relative precision boost on VG200 dataset - and qualitative improvements to prove the significance of our GCD method and our metrics towards refocusing graph generation as a core aspect of scene understanding.

    * Abstract: We consider the shuffled linear regression problem where the correspondences between covariates and responses are unknown. While the existing formulation assumes an ideal underlying bijection in which all pieces of data should match, such an assumption barely holds in real-world applications due to either missing data or outliers. Therefore, in this work, we generalize the formulation of shuffled linear regression to a broader range of conditions where only part of the data should correspond. Moreover, we present a remarkably simple yet effective optimization algorithm with guaranteed global convergence. Distinct tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: Finding local features that are repeatable across multiple views is a cornerstone of sparse 3D reconstruction. The classical image matching paradigm detects keypoints per-image once and for all, which can yield poorly-localized features and propagate large errors to the final geometry. In this paper, we refine two key steps of structure-from-motion by a direct alignment of low-level image information from multiple views: we first adjust the initial keypoint locations prior to any geometric estimation, and subsequently refine points and camera poses as a post-processing. This refinement is robust to large detection noise and appearance changes, as it optimizes a featuremetric error based on dense features predicted by a neural network. This significantly improves the accuracy of camera poses and scene geometry for a wide range of keypoint detectors, challenging viewing conditions, and off-the-shelf deep features. Our system easily scales to large image collections, enabling pixel-perfect crowd-sourced localization at scale. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cvg/pixel-perfect-sfm as an add-on to the popular SfM software COLMAP.

    * Abstract: This work proposes a weakly-supervised temporal action localization framework, called D2-Net, which strives to temporally localize actions using video-level supervision. Our main contribution is the introduction of a novel loss formulation, which jointly enhances the discriminability of latent embeddings and robustness of the output temporal class activations with respect to foreground-background noise caused by weak supervision. The proposed formulation comprises a discriminative and a denoising loss term for enhancing temporal action localization. The discriminative term incorporates a classification loss and utilizes a top-down attention mechanism to enhance the separability of latent foreground-background embeddings. The denoising loss term explicitly addresses the foreground-background noise in class activations by simultaneously maximizing intra-video and inter-video mutual information using a bottom-up attention mechanism. As a result, activations in the foreground regions are emphasized whereas those in the background regions are suppressed, thereby leading to more robust predictions. Comprehensive experiments are performed on multiple benchmarks, including THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2. Our D2-Net performs favorably in comparison to the existing methods on all datasets, achieving gains as high as 2.3% in terms of mAP at IoU=0.5 on THUMOS14.

    * Abstract: We tackle object category discovery, which is the problem of discovering and localizing novel objects in a large unlabeled dataset. While existing methods show results on datasets with less cluttered scenes and fewer object instances per image, we present our results on the challenging COCO dataset. Moreover, we argue that, rather than discovering new categories from scratch, discovery algorithms can benefit from identifying what is already known and focusing their attention on the unknown. We propose a method that exploits prior knowledge about certain object types to discover new categories by leveraging two memory modules, namely Working and Semantic memory. We show the performance of our detector on the COCO minival dataset to demonstrate its in-the-wild capabilities.

    * Abstract: We present GTT-Net, a supervised learning framework for the reconstruction of sparse dynamic 3D geometry. We build on a graph-theoretic formulation of the generalized trajectory triangulation problem, where non-concurrent multi-view imaging geometry is known but global image sequencing is not provided. GTT-Net learns pairwise affinities modeling the spatio-temporal relationships among our input observations and leverages them to determine 3D geometry estimates. Experiments reconstructing 3D motion-capture sequences show GTT-Net outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and robustness. Within the context of articulated motion reconstruction, our proposed architecture is 1) able to learn and enforce semantic 3D motion priors for shared training and test domains, while being 2) able to generalize its performance across different training and test domains. Moreover, GTT-Net provides a computationally streamlined framework for trajectory triangulation with applications to multi-instance reconstruction and event segmentation.

    * Abstract: Arbitrary shape text detection is a challenging task due to the high complexity and variety of scene texts. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive boundary proposal network for arbitrary shape text detection, which can learn to directly produce accurate boundary for arbitrary shape text without any post-processing. Our method mainly consists of a boundary proposal model and an innovative adaptive boundary deformation model. The boundary proposal model constructed by multi-layer dilated convolutions is adopted to produce prior information (including classification map, distance field, and direction field) and coarse boundary proposals. The adaptive boundary deformation model is an encoder-decoder network, in which the encoder mainly consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It aims to perform boundary deformation in an iterative way for obtaining text instance shape guided by prior information from the boundary proposal model. In this way, our method can directly and efficiently generate accurate text boundaries without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

    * Abstract: Moving object detection has been a central topic of discussion in computer vision for its wide range of applications like in self-driving cars, video surveillance, security, and enforcement. Neuromorphic Vision Sensors (NVS) are bio-inspired sensors that mimic the working of the human eye. Unlike conventional frame-based cameras, these sensors capture a stream of asynchronous 'events' that pose multiple advantages over the former, like high dynamic range, low latency, low power consumption, and reduced motion blur. However, these advantages come at a high cost, as the event camera data typically contains more noise and has low resolution. Moreover, as event-based cameras can only capture the relative changes in brightness of a scene, event data do not contain usual visual information (like texture and color) as available in video data from normal cameras. So, moving object detection in event-based cameras becomes an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we present an unsupervised Graph Spectral Clustering technique for Moving Object Detection in Event-based data (GSCEventMOD). We additionally show how the optimum number of moving objects can be automatically determined. Experimental comparisons on publicly available datasets show that the proposed GSCEventMOD algorithm outperforms a number of state-of-the-art techniques by a maximum margin of 30%.

    * Abstract: Food image classification is challenging for real-world applications since existing methods require static datasets for training and are not capable of learning from sequentially available new food images. Online continual learning aims to learn new classes from data stream by using each new data only once without forgetting the previously learned knowledge. However, none of the existing works target food image analysis, which is more difficult to learn incrementally due to its high intra-class variation with the unbalanced and unpredictable characteristics of future food class distribution. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing (1) a novel clustering based exemplar selection algorithm to store the most representative data belonging to each learned food for knowledge replay, and (2) an effective online learning regime using balanced training batch along with the knowledge distillation on augmented exemplars to maintain the model performance on all learned classes. Our method is evaluated on a challenging large scale food image database, Food-1K, by varying the number of newly added food classes. Our results show significant improvements compared with existing state-of-the-art online continual learning methods, showing great potential to achieve lifelong learning for food image classification in real world.

    * Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is associated with a high rate of pulmonary embolism (PE). In patients with contraindications for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or non-diagnostic on CTPA, perfusion single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (Q-SPECT/CT) is a diagnosis option. The goal of this work is to develop an Intelligent Radiomic system for the detection of PE in COVID-19 patients from the analysis of Q-SPECT/CT scans. Our Intelligent Radiomic System for identification of patients with PE (with/without pneumonia) is based on a local analysis of SPECT-CT volumes that considers both CT and SPECT values for each volume point. We present an hybrid approach that uses radiomic features extracted from each scan as input to a siamese classification network trained to discriminate among 4 different types of tissue: no pneumonia without PE (control group), no pneumonia with PE, pneumonia without PE and pneumonia with PE. The proposed radiomic system has been tested on 133 patients, 63 with COVID-19 (26 with PE, 22 without PE, 15 indeterminate-PE) and 70 without COVID-19 (31 healthy/control, 39 with PE). The per-patient recall for the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia with PE was, respectively, 91% and 81% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves equal to 0.99 and 0.87.

We propose a practical method for testing finite solvability, i.e., whether a viewing graph induces a finite number of camera configurations. Our formulation uses a significantly smaller number of equations (up to 400x) with respect to previous work. As a result, this is the only method in the literature that can be applied to large viewing graphs coming from real datasets, comprising up to 300K edges. In addition, we develop the first algorithm for identifying maximal finite-solvable components.

Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-stage technical schemes and are computationally expensive, SeRum converts document image understanding and recognition tasks into a local decoding process of the vision tokens of interest, using a content-aware token merge module. This mechanism enables the model to pay more attention to regions of interest generated by the query decoder, improving the model's effectiveness and speeding up the decoding speed of the generative scheme. We also designed several pre-training tasks to enhance the understanding and local awareness of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that SeRum achieves state-of-the-art performance on document understanding tasks and competitive results on text spotting tasks. SeRum represents a substantial advancement towards enabling efficient and effective end-to-end document understanding.

    * Abstract: A camera's auto-white-balance (AWB) module operates under the assumption that there is a single dominant illumination in a captured scene. AWB methods estimate an image's dominant illumination and use it as the target "white point" for correction. However, in natural scenes, there are often many light sources present. We performed a user study that revealed that non-dominant illuminations often produce visually pleasing white-balanced images and, in some cases, are even preferred over the dominant illumination. Motivated by this observation, we revisit AWB to predict a distribution of plausible illuminations for use in white balance. As part of this effort, we extend the Cube++ illumination estimation dataset to provide ground truth illumination distributions per image. Using this new ground truth data, we describe how to train a lightweight neural network method to predict the scene's illumination distribution. We describe how our idea can be used with existing image formats by embedding the estimated distribution in the RAW image to enable users to generate visually plausible white-balance images.

    * Abstract: We present Text2Room, a method for generating room-scale textured 3D meshes from a given text prompt as input. To this end, we leverage pre-trained 2D text-to-image models to synthesize a sequence of images from different poses. In order to lift these outputs into a consistent 3D scene representation, we combine monocular depth estimation with a text-conditioned inpainting model. The core idea of our approach is a tailored viewpoint selection such that the content of each image can be fused into a seamless, textured 3D mesh. More specifically, we propose a continuous alignment strategy that iteratively fuses scene frames with the existing geometry to create a seamless mesh. Unlike existing works that focus on generating single objects [56, 41] or zoom-out trajectories [18] from text, our method generates complete 3D scenes with multiple objects and explicit 3D geometry. We evaluate our approach using qualitative and quantitative metrics, demonstrating it as the first method to generate room-scale 3D geometry with compelling textures from only text as input.

    * Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) aim to learn a continuous function (i.e., a neural network) to represent an image, where the input and output of the function are pixel coordinates and RGB/Gray values, respectively. However, images tend to consist of many objects whose colors are not perfectly consistent, resulting in the challenge that image is actually a discontinuous piecewise function and cannot be well estimated by a continuous function. In this paper, we empirically investigate that if a neural network is enforced to fit a discontinuous piecewise function to reach a fixed small error, the time costs will increase exponentially with respect to the boundaries in the spatial domain of the target signal. We name this phenomenon the exponential-increase hypothesis. Under the exponential-increase hypothesis, learning INRs for images with many objects will converge very slowly. To address this issue, we first prove that partitioning a complex signal into several sub-regions and utilizing piecewise INRs to fit that signal can significantly speed up the convergence. Based on this fact, we introduce a simple partition mechanism to boost the performance of two INR methods for image reconstruction: one for learning INRs, and the other for learning-to-learn INRs. In both cases, we partition an image into different sub-regions and dedicate smaller networks for each part. In addition, we further propose two partition rules based on regular grids and semantic segmentation maps, respectively. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning methods in terms of learning INR for a single image (ordinary learning framework) and the learning-to-learn framework.

    * Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to train models with only anomaly-free images to detect and localize unseen anomalies. Previous reconstruction-based methods have been limited by inaccurate reconstruction results. This work presents a denoising model to detect and localize the anomalies with a generative diffusion model. In particular, we introduce random noise to overwhelm the anomalous pixels and obtain pixel-wise precise anomaly scores from the intermediate denoising process. We find that the KL divergence of the diffusion model serves as a better anomaly score compared with the traditional RGB space score. Furthermore, we reconstruct the features from a pre-trained deep feature extractor as our feature level score to improve localization performance. Moreover, we propose a gradient denoising process to smoothly transform an anomalous image into a normal one. Our denoising model outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods for precise anomaly localization and high-quality normal image reconstruction on the MVTec-AD benchmark.

    * Abstract: Closed-set 3D perception models trained on only a pre-defined set of object categories can be inadequate for safety critical applications such as autonomous driving where new object types can be encountered after deployment. In this paper, we present a multi-modal auto labeling pipeline capable of generating amodal 3D bounding boxes and tracklets for training models on open-set categories without 3D human labels. Our pipeline exploits motion cues inherent in point cloud sequences in combination with the freely available 2D image-text pairs to identify and track all traffic participants. Compared to the recent studies in this domain, which can only provide class-agnostic auto labels limited to moving objects, our method can handle both static and moving objects in the unsupervised manner and is able to output open-vocabulary semantic labels thanks to the proposed vision-language knowledge distillation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that our approach outperforms the prior work by significant margins on various unsupervised 3D perception tasks.

    * Abstract: Standard semantic segmentation models owe their success to curated datasets with a fixed set of semantic categories, without contemplating the possibility of identifying unknown objects from novel categories. Existing methods in outlier detection suffer from a lack of smoothness and objectness in their predictions, due to limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm. Furthermore, additional training for detecting outliers harms the performance of known classes. In this paper, we explore another paradigm with region-level classification to better segment unknown objects. We show that the object queries in mask classification tend to behave like one vs. all classifiers. Based on this finding, we propose a novel outlier scoring function called RbA by defining the event of being an outlier as being rejected by all known classes. Our extensive experiments show that mask classification improves the performance of the existing outlier detection methods, and the best results are achieved with the proposed RbA. We also propose an objective to optimize RbA using minimal outlier supervision. Further fine-tuning with outliers improves the unknown performance, and unlike previous methods, it does not degrade the inlier performance. Project page: https://kuis-ai.github.io/RbA

    * Abstract: This work investigates the use of smooth neural networks for modeling dynamic variations of implicit surfaces under the level set equation (LSE). For this, it extends the representation of neural implicit surfaces to the space-time, which opens up mechanisms for continuous geometric transformations. Examples include evolving an initial surface towards general vector fields, smoothing and sharpening using the mean curvature equation, and interpolations of initial conditions. The network training considers two constraints. A data term is responsible for fitting the initial condition to the corresponding time instant. Then, a LSE term forces the network to approximate the underlying geometric evolution given by the LSE, without any supervision. The network can also be initialized based on previously trained initial conditions, resulting in faster convergence compared to the standard approach.

    * Abstract: Accurate segmentation of topological tubular structures, such as blood vessels and roads, is crucial in various fields, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in downstream tasks. However, many factors complicate the task, including thin local structures and variable global morphologies. In this work, we note the specificity of tubular structures and use this knowledge to guide our DSCNet to simultaneously enhance perception in three stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss constraint. First, we propose a dynamic snake convolution to accurately capture the features of tubular structures by adaptively focusing on slender and tortuous local structures. Subsequently, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy to complement the attention to features from multiple perspectives during feature fusion, ensuring the retention of important information from different global morphologies. Finally, a continuity constraint loss function, based on persistent homology, is proposed to constrain the topological continuity of the segmentation better. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that our DSCNet provides better accuracy and continuity on the tubular structure segmentation task compared with several methods.

    * Abstract: We tackle the challenging task of unsupervised object localization in this work. Recently, transformers trained with self-supervised learning have been shown to exhibit object localization properties without being trained for this task. In this work, we present Multiple Object localization with Self-supervised Transformers (MOST) that uses features of transformers trained using self-supervised learning to localize multiple objects in real world images. MOST analyzes the similarity maps of the features using box counting; a fractal analysis tool to identify tokens lying on foreground patches. The identified tokens are then clustered together, and tokens of each cluster are used to generate bounding boxes on foreground regions. Unlike recent state-of-the-art object localization methods, MOST can localize multiple objects per image and outperforms SOTA algorithms on several object localization and discovery benchmarks on PASCAL-VOC 07, 12 and COCO20k datasets. Additionally, we show that MOST can be used for self-supervised pretraining of object detectors, and yields consistent improvements on fully, semi-supervised object detection and unsupervised region proposal generation.Our project is publicly available at rssaketh.github.io/most.

    * Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for rendering a pre-trained Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) in real-time on resource-constrained devices. We introduce Re-ReND, a method enabling Real-time Rendering of NeRFs across Devices. Re-ReND is designed to achieve real-time performance by converting the NeRF into a representation that can be efficiently processed by standard graphics pipelines. The proposed method distills the NeRF by extracting the learned density into a mesh, while the learned color information is factorized into a set of matrices that represent the scene's light field. Factorization implies the field is queried via inexpensive MLP-free matrix multiplications, while using a light field allows rendering a pixel by querying the field a single time--as opposed to hundreds of queries when employing a radiance field. Since the proposed representation can be implemented using a fragment shader, it can be directly integrated with standard rasterization frameworks. Our flexible implementation can render a NeRF in real-time with low memory requirements and on a wide range of resource-constrained devices, including mobiles and AR/VR headsets. Notably, we find that Re-ReND can achieve over a 2.6-fold increase in rendering speed versus the state-of-the-art without perceptible losses in quality.

    * Abstract: Recent work in unsupervised multi-object segmentation shows impressive results by predicting motion from a single image despite the inherent ambiguity in predicting motion without the next image. On the other hand, the set of possible motions for an image can be constrained to a low-dimensional space by considering the scene structure and moving objects in it. We propose to model pixel-wise geometry and object motion to remove ambiguity in reconstructing flow from a single image. Specifically, we divide the image into coherently moving regions and use depth to construct flow bases that best explain the observed flow in each region. We achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised multi-object segmentation on synthetic and real-world datasets by modeling the scene structure and object motion. Our evaluation of the predicted depth maps shows reliable performance in monocular depth estimation.

    * Authors: Nermin Samet, Oriane Siméoni, Gilles Puy, Georgy Ponimatkin, Renaud Marlet, Vincent Lepetit
    * Abstract: We propose SeedAL, a method to seed active learning for efficient annotation of 3D point clouds for semantic segmentation. Active Learning (AL) iteratively selects relevant data fractions to annotate within a given budget, but requires a first fraction of the dataset (a 'seed') to be already annotated to estimate the benefit of annotating other data fractions. We first show that the choice of the seed can significantly affect the performance of many AL methods. We then propose a method for automatically constructing a seed that will ensure good performance for AL. Assuming that images of the point clouds are available, which is common, our method relies on powerful unsupervised image features to measure the diversity of the point clouds. It selects the point clouds for the seed by optimizing the diversity under an annotation budget, which can be done by solving a linear optimization problem. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to random seeding and existing methods on both the S3DIS and SemanticKitti datasets.

    * Abstract: Accurately predicting road networks from satellite images requires a global understanding of the network topology. We propose to capture such high-level information by introducing a graph-based framework that given a partially generated graph, sequentially adds new edges. To deal with misalignment between the model predictions and the intended purpose, and to optimize over complex, non-continuous metrics of interest, we adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that nominates modifications that maximize a cumulative reward. As opposed to standard supervised techniques that tend to be more restricted to commonly used surrogate losses, our framework yields more power and flexibility to encode problem-dependent knowledge. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate enhanced performance and increased high-level reasoning about the graph topology when using a tree-based search. We further demonstrate the superiority of our approach in handling examples with substantial occlusion and additionally provide evidence that our predictions better match the statistical properties of the ground dataset.

    * Abstract: Unsupervised optical flow estimation is especially hard near occlusions and motion boundaries and in low-texture regions. We show that additional information such as semantics and domain knowledge can help better constrain this problem. We introduce SemARFlow, an unsupervised optical flow network designed for autonomous driving data that takes estimated semantic segmentation masks as additional inputs. This additional information is injected into the encoder and into a learned upsampler that refines the flow output. In addition, a simple yet effective semantic augmentation module provides self-supervision when learning flow and its boundaries for vehicles, poles, and sky. Together, these injections of semantic information improve the KITTI-2015 optical flow test error rate from 11.80% to 8.38%. We also show visible improvements around object boundaries as well as a greater ability to generalize across datasets.

    * Abstract: Fully- and semi-supervised semantic segmentation of biomedical images have been advanced with the development of deep neural networks (DNNs). So far, however, DNN models are usually designed to support one of these two learning schemes, unified models that support both fully- and semi-supervised segmentation remain limited. Furthermore, few fully-supervised models focus on the intrinsic low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) information of images to improve performance. Perturbations in consistency-based semi-supervised models are often artificially designed. They may introduce negative learning bias that are not beneficial for training. In this study, we propose a wavelet-based LF and HF fusion model XNet, which supports both fully- and semi-supervised semantic segmentation and outperforms state-of-the-art models in both fields. It emphasizes extracting LF and HF information for consistency training to alleviate the learning bias caused by artificial perturbations. Extensive experiments on two 2D and two 3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Code is available at https://github.com/Yanfeng-Zhou/XNet.

Each key frame is annotated with 8 thing, 3 stuff classes and 19 global scene attributes. We report the results of 27 semantic and panoptic segmentation methods, along with several performance insights and future research directions.

    * Abstract: Segmenting objects like cells or nuclei in biomedical microscopy data is a standard task required for many downstream analyses. However, existing pre-trained models are continuously challenged by ever-evolving experimental setups and imaging platforms. On the other hand, training new models still requires a considerable number of annotated samples, rendering it infeasible for small to mid-sized experiments. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach for instance segmentation that leverages a small number of annotated samples together with a larger number of unannotated samples. Our pipeline, Augmentation Consistency Training for Instance Segmentation (ACTIS), incorporates methods from consistency regularization and entropy minimization. In addition, we introduce a robust confidence-based loss masking scheme which we find empirically to work well on highly imbalanced class frequencies. We show that our model can surpass the performance of supervised models trained on more than twice as much annotated data. It achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets in the biomedical domain, demonstrating its effectiveness for semi-supervised instance segmentation.

    * Abstract: The design of personalized cranial implants is a challenging and tremendous task that has become a hot topic in terms of process automation with the use of deep learning techniques. The main challenge is associated with the high diversity of possible cranial defects. The lack of appropriate data sources negatively influences the data-driven nature of deep learning algorithms. Hence, one of the possible solutions to overcome this problem is to rely on synthetic data. In this work, we propose three volumetric variations of deep generative models to augment the dataset by generating synthetic skulls, i.e. Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), WGAN-GP hybrid with Variational Autoencoder pretraining (VAE/WGAN-GP) and Introspective Variational Autoencoder (IntroVAE). We show that it is possible to generate dozens of thousands of defective skulls with compatible defects that achieve a trade-off between defect heterogeneity and the realistic shape of the skull. We evaluate obtained synthetic data quantitatively by defect segmentation with the use of V-Net and qualitatively by their latent space exploration. We show that the synthetically generated skulls highly improve the segmentation process compared to using only the original unaugmented data. The generated skulls may improve the automatic design of personalized cranial implants for real medical cases.

    * Abstract: Assuming that scenes are static is common in SLAM research. However, the world is complex, dynamic, and features interactive agents. Mobile robots operating in a variety of environments in real-life scenarios require an advanced level of understanding of their surroundings. Therefore, it is crucial to find effective ways of representing the world in its dynamic complexity, beyond the geometry of static scene elements. We present a framework that enables incremental reconstruction of semantically-annotated 3D models in dynamic settings using commodity RGB-D sensors. Our method is the first to perform semantic reconstruction of non-rigidly deforming objects along with a static background. FullFusion is a step towards enabling robots to have a deeper and richer understanding of their surroundings, and can facilitate the study of interaction and scene dynamics. To showcase the potential of FullFusion, we provide a quantitative and qualitative evaluation on a baseline implementation which employs specific reconstruction and segmentation pipelines. It is, however, important to highlight that the modular design of the framework allows us to easily replace any of the components with new or existing counterparts.

    * Authors: Andrew Brown, Pascal Mettes, Marcel Worring
    * Abstract: The shift operation was recently introduced as an alternative to spatial convolutions. The operation moves subsets of activations horizontally and/or vertically. Spatial convolutions are then replaced with shift operations followed by point-wise convolutions, significantly reducing computational costs. In this work, we investigate how shifts should best be applied to high accuracy CNNs. We apply shifts of two different neighbourhood groups to ResNet on ImageNet: the originally introduced 8-connected (8C) neighbourhood shift and the less well studied 4-connected (4C) neighbourhood shift. We find that when replacing ResNet's spatial convolutions with shifts, both shift neighbourhoods give equal ImageNet accuracy, showing the sufficiency of small neighbourhoods for large images. Interestingly, when incorporating shifts to all point-wise convolutions in residual networks, 4-connected shifts outperform 8-connected shifts. Such a 4-connected shift setup gives the same accuracy as full residual networks while reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs by over 40%. We then highlight that without spatial convolutions, ResNet's downsampling/upsampling bottleneck channel structure is no longer needed. We show a new, 4C shift-based residual network, much shorter than the original ResNet yet with a higher accuracy for the same computational cost. This network is the highest accuracy shift-based network yet shown, demonstrating the potential of shifting in deep neural networks.

Combining the classification of pixels by rPCA and depth map, topological labelling of pixels of each frame in an image sequence is achieved. The algorithm constructs static stixels and moving boxes of an image sequence from background and foreground regions, respectively. The algorithm also estimates free-space for motion planning from background regions as a collection of horizontal columnar-superpixels parallel to the epipolar lines.

    * Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly important due to their excellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However, regularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the complex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring function complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive regularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in statistical learning theory. In this work, we study the tractability of function norms for deep neural networks with ReLU activations. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the literature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs of 3 or more layers. We also highlight a fundamental difference between shallow and deep networks. In the light on these results, we propose a new regularization strategy based on approximate function norms, and show its efficiency on a segmentation task with a DNN.

    * Abstract: We address the problem of joint detection and segmentation of multiple object instances in an image, a key step towards scene understanding. Inspired by data-driven methods, we propose an exemplar-based approach to the task of multi-instance segmentation using a small set of annotated reference images. We design a novel CRF model that jointly models object appearance, shape deformation, and object occlusion at the superpixel level. To tackle the challenging MAP inference problem, we derive an alternating procedure that interleaves object segmentation and layout adaptation.

    * Abstract: We present a model for video segmentation, applicable to RGB (and if available RGB-D) information that constructs multiple plausible partitions corresponding to the static and the moving objects in the scene: i) we generate multiple figure-ground segmentations, in each frame, parametrically, based on boundary and optical flow cues, then track, link and refine the salient segment chains corresponding to the different objects, over time, using long-range temporal constraints; ii) a video partition is obtained by composing segment chains into consistent tilings, where the different individual object chains explain the video and do not overlap. Saliency metrics based on figural and motion cues, as well as measures learned from human eye movements are exploited, with substantial gain, at the level of segment generation and chain construction, in order to produce compact sets of hypotheses which correctly reflect the qualities of the different configurations. The model makes it possible to compute multiple hypotheses over both individual object segmentations tracked over time, and for complete video partitions. We report quantitative, state of the art results in the SegTrack single object benchmark, and promising qualitative and quantitative results in clips filming multiple static and moving objects collected from Hollywood movies and from the MIT dataset.

    * Abstract: Detecting traversable road areas ahead a moving vehicle is a key process for modern autonomous driving systems. Most existing algorithms use color to classify pixels as road or background. These algorithms reduce the effect of lighting variations and weather conditions by exploiting the discriminant/invariant properties of different color representations. However, up to date, no comparison between these representations have been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of existing color representations for road detection. More specifically, we focus on color planes derived from RGB data and their most common combinations. The evaluation is done on a set of 7000 road images acquired using an on-board camera in different real-driving situations.

    * Abstract: The gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) method can faithfully highlight important regions in images for deep model prediction in image classification, image captioning and many other tasks. It uses the gradients in back-propagation as weights (grad-weights) to explain network decisions. However, applying Grad-CAM to embedding networks raises significant challenges because embedding networks are trained by millions of dynamically paired examples (e.g. triplets). To overcome these challenges, we propose an adaptation of the Grad-CAM method for embedding networks. First, we aggregate grad-weights from multiple training examples to improve the stability of Grad-CAM. Then, we develop an efficient weight-transfer method to explain decisions for any image without back-propagation. We extensively validate the method on the standard CUB200 dataset in which our method produces more accurate visual attention than the original Grad-CAM method. We also apply the method to a house price estimation application using images. The method produces convincing qualitative results, showcasing the practicality of our approach.

    * Abstract: Temporal action localization is an important step towards video understanding. Most current action localization methods depend on untrimmed videos with full temporal annotations of action instances. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to annotate both action labels and temporal boundaries of videos. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised temporal action localization method that only requires video-level action instances as supervision during training. We propose a classification module to generate action labels for each segment in the video, and a deep metric learning module to learn the similarity between different action instances. We jointly optimize a balanced binary cross-entropy loss and a metric loss using a standard backpropagation algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both of these components in temporal localization. We evaluate our algorithm on two challenging untrimmed video datasets: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2. Our approach improves the current state-of-the-art result for THUMOS14 by 6.5% mAP at IoU threshold 0.5, and achieves competitive performance for ActivityNet1.2.

    * Abstract: Effective analysis of hyperspectral imagery is essential for gathering fast and actionable information of large areas affected by atmospheric and green house gases. Existing methods, which process hyperspectral data to detect amorphous gases such as CH4 require manual inspection from domain experts and annotation of massive datasets. These methods do not scale well and are prone to human errors due to the plumes' small pixel-footprint signature. The proposed Hyperspectral Mask-RCNN (H-mrcnn) uses principled statistics, signal processing, and deep neural networks to address these limitations. H-mrcnn introduces fast algorithms to analyze large-area hyper-spectral information and methods to autonomously represent and detect CH4 plumes. H-mrcnn processes information by match-filtering sliding windows of hyperspectral data across the spectral bands. This process produces information-rich features that are both effective plume representations and gas concentration analogs. The optimized matched-filtering stage processes spectral data, which is spatially sampled to train an ensemble of gas detectors. The ensemble outputs are fused to estimate a natural and accurate plume mask. Thorough evaluation demonstrates that H-mrcnn matches the manual and experience-dependent annotation process of experts by 85% (IOU). H-mrcnn scales to larger datasets, reduces the manual data processing and labeling time (12 times), and produces rapid actionable information about gas plumes.

    * Abstract: Visualization tools like t-SNE and UMAP give insight into the high-dimensional structure of datasets. When there are related datasets (such as the high-dimensional representations of image data created by two different Deep Learning architectures), roughly aligning those visualizations helps to highlight both the similarities and differences. In this paper we propose a method to align multiple low dimensional visualizations by adding an alignment term to the UMAP loss function. We provide an automated procedure to find a weight for this term that encourages the alignment but only minimally changes the fidelity of the underlying embedding.

    * Authors: Bharathkumar Ramachandra,  Michael Jones,  Ranga Vatsavai
    * Abstract: This work introduces a new approach to localize anomalies in surveillance video. The main novelty is the idea of using a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a distance function between a pair of video patches (spatio-temporal regions of video). The learned distance function, which is not specific to the target video, is used to measure the distance between each video patch in the testing video and the video patches found in normal training video. If a testing video patch is not similar to any normal video patch then it must be anomalous. We compare our approach to previously published algorithms using 4 evaluation measures and 3 challenging target benchmark datasets. Experiments show that our approach either surpasses or performs comparably to current state-of-the-art methods.

In addition to the new dataset and evaluation criteria, we present two variations of a novel baseline video anomaly detection algorithm and show they are much more accurate on Street Scene than two well known algorithms from the literature.

    * Abstract: Achieving robust pose tracking and mapping in highly dynamic environments is a major challenge faced by existing visual SLAM (vSLAM) systems. In this paper, we increase the robustness of existing vSLAM by accurately removing moving objects from the scene so that they will not contribute to pose estimation and mapping. Specifically, semantic information is fused with motion states of the scene via a probability framework to enable accurate and robust moving object extraction in order to retain the useful features for pose estimation and mapping. Our work highlights the importance of distinguishing between motion states of potential moving objects for vSLAM in highly dynamic environments. The proposed method can be integrated into existing vSLAM systems to increase their robustness in dynamic environments without incurring much computation cost. We provide extensive experimental results on three well-known datasets to show that the proposed technique outperforms existing vSLAM methods in indoor and outdoor environments, under various scenarios such as crowded scenes.

Here, we focus on the automatic extraction of visual features from each person, including her/his facial activity, body movement, and hand position, and how these features co-occur among team members (e.g., how frequently a person moves her/his arms or makes eye contact when she/he is the focus of attention of the group). We correlate these features with user questionnaires to reveal relationships with the "Big Five" personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), as well as with team judgements about the leader and dominant contributor in a conversation. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with an average of 80% for Big-Five personality trait prediction, potentially enabling integration into automatic group meeting understanding systems.

    * Abstract: Camera-based end-to-end driving neural networks bring the promise of a low-cost system that maps camera images to driving control commands. These networks are appealing because they replace laborious hand engineered building blocks but their black-box nature makes them difficult to delve in case of failure. Recent works have shown the importance of using an explicit intermediate representation that has the benefits of increasing both the interpretability and the accuracy of networks' decisions. Nonetheless, these camera-based networks reason in camera view where scale is not homogeneous and hence not directly suitable for motion forecasting. In this paper, we introduce a novel monocular camera-only holistic end-to-end trajectory planning network with a Bird-Eye-View (BEV) intermediate representation that comes in the form of binary Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). To ease the prediction of OGMs in BEV from camera images, we introduce a novel scheme where the OGMs are first predicted as semantic masks in camera view and then warped in BEV using the homography between the two planes. The key element allowing this transformation to be applied to 3D objects such as vehicles, consists in predicting solely their footprint in camera-view, hence respecting the flat world hypothesis implied by the homography.

    * Abstract: Human pose information is a critical component in many downstream image processing tasks, such as activity recognition and motion tracking. Likewise, a pose estimator for the illustrated character domain would provide a valuable prior for assistive content creation tasks, such as reference pose retrieval and automatic character animation. But while modern data-driven techniques have substantially improved pose estimation performance on natural images, little work has been done for illustrations. In our work, we bridge this domain gap by efficiently transfer-learning from both domain-specific and task-specific source models. Additionally, we upgrade and expand an existing illustrated pose estimation dataset, and introduce two new datasets for classification and segmentation subtasks. We then apply the resultant state-of-the-art character pose estimator to solve the novel task of pose-guided illustration retrieval. All data, models, and code will be made publicly available.

    * Abstract: Learning to identify similar products in the e-commerce domain has widespread applications such as ensuring consistent grouping of the products in the catalog, avoiding duplicates in the search results, etc. Here, we address the problem of learning product similarity for highly challenging real-world data from the Amazon catalog. We define it as a metric learning problem, where similar products are projected close to each other and dissimilar ones are projected further apart. To this end, we propose a scalable end-to-end multimodal framework for product representation learning in a weakly supervised setting using raw data from the catalog. This includes product images as well as textual attributes like product title and category information. The model uses the image as the primary source of information, while the title helps the model focus on relevant regions in the image by ignoring the background clutter. To validate our approach, we created multimodal datasets covering three broad product categories, where we achieve up to 10% improvement in precision compared to state-of-the-art multimodal benchmark. Along with this, we also incorporate several effective heuristics for training data generation, which further complements the overall training. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the product title makes the model scale effectively across multiple product categories.

    * Abstract: Reading irregular scene text is a challenging problem in scene text recognition. Rectification is a popular measure to reduce irregularities of text in images. Existing rectification methods seek to rectify text images into a strictly regular form via free parametric transformation functions. However, they always suffer from information loss or severe deformation due to their poor constraints to the transformation functions. In our investigation, we found that CNN and attention are robust to many slight irregularities. That inspires us to propose a novel and effective rectification method that mainly rectifies the principle regularities, and leaves the slight irregularities to the CNNLSTM-attention recognizer. Our rectification method first estimates the character densities and directions of the input image in a down-sampled map, then finds a best fitting curve from a small predefined Bezier curve set, and finally rectifies the input image with a transformation function corresponding to the selected curve. Transformation functions are carefully designed so that they neither lose important visual information nor cause severe deformation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that our method achieves the state of the art performance in most cases, especially in curved text recognition.

    * Abstract: Multi-view approaches to people-tracking have the potential to better handle occlusions than single-view ones in crowded scenes. They often rely on the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which involves detecting people first and then connecting the detections. In this paper, we argue that an even more effective approach is to predict people motion over time and infer people's presence in individual frames from these. This enables to enforce consistency both over time and across views of a single temporal frame. We validate our approach on the PETS2009 and WILDTRACK datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    * Authors: Min Woo Kim, Nam Ik Cho
    * Abstract: Even a rough sketch can effectively convey the descriptions of objects, as humans can imagine the original shape from the sketch. The sketch-to-photo translation is a computer vision task that enables a machine to do this imagination, taking a binary sketch image and generating plausible RGB images corresponding to the sketch. Hence, deep neural networks for this task should learn to generate a wide range of frequencies because most parts of the input (binary sketch image) are composed of DC signals. In this paper, we propose a new loss function named Wavelet-domain High-Frequency Loss (WHFL) to overcome the limitations of previous methods that tend to have a bias toward low frequencies. The proposed method emphasizes the loss on the high frequencies by designing a new weight matrix imposing larger weights on the high bands. Unlike existing hand-craft methods that control frequency weights using binary masks, we use the matrix with finely controlled elements according to frequency scales. The WHFL is designed in a multi-scale form, which lets the loss function focus more on the high frequency according to decomposition levels. We use the WHFL as a complementary loss in addition to conventional ones defined in the spatial domain. Experiments show we can improve the qualitative and quantitative results in both spatial and frequency domains.

    * Abstract: Cell instance segmentation that recognizes each cell boundary is an important task in cell image analysis. While deep learning-based methods have shown promising performances with a certain amount of training data, most of them require full annotations that show the boundary of each cell. Generating the annotation for cell segmentation is time-consuming and human labor. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose a weakly supervised segmentation method using two types of weak labels (one for cell type and one for nuclei position). Unlike general images, these two labels are easily obtained in phase-contrast images. The intercellular boundary, which is necessary for cell instance segmentation, cannot be directly obtained from these two weak labels, so to generate the boundary information, we propose a single instance pasting based on the copy-and-paste technique. First, we locate single-cell regions by counting cells and store them in a pool. Then, we generate the intercellular boundary by pasting the stored single-cell regions to the original image. Finally, we train a boundary estimation network with the generated labels and perform instance segmentation with the network. Our evaluation on a public dataset demonstrated that the proposed method achieves the best performance among the several weakly supervised methods we compared.

    * Abstract: Deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable progress in document understanding. Most models use coordinates to represent absolute or relative spatial information of components, but they are difficult to represent latent rules in the document layout. This makes learning layout representation to be more difficult. Unlike the previous researches which have employed the coordinate system, graph or grid to represent the document layout, we propose a novel layout representation, the cell-based layout, to provide easy-to-understand spatial information for backbone models. In line with human reading habits, it uses cell information, i.e. row and column index, to represent the position of components in a document, and makes the document layout easier to understand. Furthermore, we proposed the multi-scale layout to represent the hierarchical structure of layout, and developed a data augmentation method to improve the performance. Experiment results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in text-based tasks, including form understanding and receipt understanding, and improves the performance in image-based task such as document image classification. We released the code in the repo.

    * Abstract: Over the last decade, online lecture videos have become increasingly popular and have experienced a meteoric rise during the pandemic. However, video-language research has primarily focused on instructional videos or movies, and tools to help students navigate the growing online lectures are lacking. Our first contribution is to facilitate research in the educational domain, by introducing AVLectures, a large-scale dataset consisting of 86 courses with over 2,350 lectures covering various STEM subjects. Each course contains video lectures, transcripts, OCR outputs for lecture frames, and optionally lecture notes, slides, assignments, and related educational content that can inspire a variety of tasks. Our second contribution is introducing video lecture segmentation that splits lectures into bite-sized topics that show promise in improving learner engagement. We formulate lecture segmentation as an unsupervised task that leverages visual, textual, and OCR cues from the lecture, while clip representations are fine-tuned on a pretext self-supervised task of matching the narration with the temporally aligned visual content. We use these representations to generate segments using a temporally consistent 1-nearest neighbor algorithm, TW-FINCH. We evaluate our method on 15 courses and compare it against various visual and textual baselines, outperforming all of them. Our comprehensive ablation studies also identify the key factors driving the success of our approach.

    * Abstract: Unsupervised Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation aims to segment an image into regions referring to an arbitrary set of concepts described by text, without relying on dense annotations that are available only for a subset of the categories. Previous works relied on inducing pixel-level alignment in a multi-modal space through contrastive training over vast corpora of image-caption pairs. However, representing a semantic category solely through its textual embedding is insufficient to encompass the wide-ranging variability in the visual appearances of the images associated with that category. In this paper, we propose FOSSIL, a pipeline that enables a self-supervised backbone to perform open-vocabulary segmentation relying only on the visual modality. In particular, we decouple the task into two components: (1) we leverage text-conditioned diffusion models to generate a large collection of visual embeddings, starting from a set of captions. These can be retrieved at inference time to obtain a support set of references for the set of textual concepts. Further, (2) we exploit self-supervised dense features to partition the image into semantically coherent regions. We demonstrate that our approach provides strong performance on different semantic segmentation datasets, without requiring any additional training.

    * Authors: Axel De Nardin, Silvia Zottin, Claudio Piciarelli, Emanuela Colombi, Gian Luca Foresti
    * Abstract: Document layout segmentation is a challenging task due to the variability and complexity of document layouts. Ancient manuscripts in particular are often damaged by age, have very irregular layouts, and are characterized by progressive editing from different authors over a large time window. All these factors make the semantic segmentation process of specific areas, such as main text and side text, very difficult. However, the study of these manuscripts turns out to be fundamental for historians and humanists, so much so that in recent years the demand for machine learning approaches aimed at simplifying the extraction of information from these documents has consistently increased, leading document layout analysis to become an increasingly important research area. In order for machine learning techniques to be applied effectively to this task, however, a large amount of correctly and precisely labeled images is required for their training. This is obviously a limitation for this field of research as ground truth must be precisely and manually crafted by expert humanists, making it a very time-consuming process. In this paper, with the aim of overcoming this limitation, we present an efficient document layout segmentation framework, which while being trained on only one labeled page per manuscript still achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other popular approaches trained on all the available data when tested on a challenging dataset of ancient Arabic manuscripts.

    * Abstract: Developing a client-side segmentation algorithm for online sports streaming holds significant importance. For instance, in order to assess the video quality from an end-user perspective such as artifact detection, it is important to initially segment the content within the streaming playback. The challenge lies in localizing the content due to the intricate scene changes between content and non-content sections in popular sports like football, tennis, baseball, and more. Client-side content detection can be implemented in two ways: intrusively, involving the interception of network traffic and parsing service provider data and logs, or non-intrusively, which entails capturing streamed videos from content providers and subjecting them to analysis using computer vision technologies. In this paper, we introduce a non-intrusive framework that leverages a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks (DNN) to distinguish content sections from non-content sections across various online sports streaming services. Our algorithm has demonstrated a remarkable level of accuracy and effectiveness in sports broadcasting events, effectively overcoming the complexities introduced by intricate non-content insertion methods during the games.

    * Abstract: Conventional video matting outputs one alpha matte for all instances appearing in a video frame so that individual instances are not distinguished. While video instance segmentation provides time-consistent instance masks, results are unsatisfactory for matting applications, especially due to applied binarization. To remedy this deficiency, we propose Video Instance Matting (VIM), that is, estimating the alpha mattes of each instance at each frame of a video sequence. To tackle this challenging problem, we present MSG-VIM, a Mask Sequence Guided Video Instance Matting neural network, as a novel baseline model for VIM. MSG-VIM leverages a mixture of mask augmentations to make predictions robust to inaccurate and inconsistent mask guidance. It incorporates temporal mask and temporal feature guidance to improve the temporal consistency of alpha matte predictions. Furthermore, we build a new benchmark for VIM, called VIM50, which comprises 50 video clips with multiple human instances as foreground objects. To evaluate performances on the VIM task, we introduce a suitable metric called Video Instance-aware Matting Quality (VIMQ). Our proposed model MSG-VIM sets a strong baseline on the VIM50 benchmark and outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

    * Abstract: Interactive segmentation entails a human marking an image to guide how a model either creates or edits a segmentation. Our work addresses limitations of existing methods: they either only support one gesture type for marking an image (e.g., either clicks or scribbles) or require knowledge of the gesture type being employed, and require specifying whether marked regions should be included versus excluded in the final segmentation. We instead propose a simplified interactive segmentation task where a user only must mark an image, where the input can be of any gesture type without specifying the gesture type. We support this new task by introducing the first interactive segmentation dataset with multiple gesture types as well as a new evaluation metric capable of holistically evaluating interactive segmentation algorithms. We then analyze numerous interactive segmentation algorithms, including ones adapted for our novel task. While we observe promising performance overall, we also highlight areas for future improvement. To facilitate further extensions of this work, we publicly share our new dataset at https://github.com/joshmyersdean/dig.

    * Abstract: Labeling datasets for supervised object detection is a dull and time-consuming task. Errors can be easily introduced during annotation and overlooked during review, yielding inaccurate benchmarks and performance degradation of deep neural networks trained on noisy labels. In this work, we introduce a benchmark for label error detection methods on object detection datasets as well as a theoretically underpinned label error detection method and a number of baselines. We simulate four different types of randomly introduced label errors on train and test sets of well-labeled object detection datasets. For our label error detection method we assume a two-stage object detector to be given and consider the sum of both stages' classification and regression losses. The losses are computed with respect to the predictions and the noisy labels including simulated label errors, aiming at detecting the latter. We compare our method to four baselines: a naive one without deep learning, the object detector's score, the entropy of the classification softmax distribution and a probability margin based method from related work. We outperform all baselines and demonstrate that among the considered methods, ours is the only one that detects label errors of all four types efficiently, which we also derive theoretically. Furthermore, we detect real label errors a) on commonly used test datasets in object detection and b) on a proprietary dataset. In both cases we achieve low false positives rates, i.e., we detect label errors with a precision for a) of up to 71.5% and for b) with 97%.

    * Abstract: Link prediction algorithms aim to infer the existence of connections (or links) between nodes in network-structured data and are typically applied to refine the connectivity among nodes. In this work, we focus on link prediction for flow-driven spatial networks, which are embedded in a Euclidean space and relate to physical exchange and transportation processes (e.g., blood flow in vessels or traffic flow in road networks). To this end, we propose the Graph Attentive Vectors (GAV) link prediction framework. GAV models simplified dynamics of physical flow in spatial networks via an attentive, neighborhood-aware message-passing paradigm, updating vector embeddings in a constrained manner. We evaluate GAV on eight flow-driven spatial networks given by whole-brain vessel graphs and road networks. GAV demonstrates superior performances across all datasets and metrics and outperformed the state-of-the-art on the ogbl-vessel benchmark at the time of submission by 12% (98.38 vs. 87.98 AUC).

To avoid any real resampling, we have linked this problem with finite group action and converted it into a problem of orbit enumeration. For further computational cost reduction, an efficient method is developed to list all orbits by their symmetry order and calculate all index function orbit sums and data function orbit sums recursively. The computational complexity analysis shows reduction in the computational cost from n! or nn level to low-order polynomial level.

    * Abstract: A key problem in statistics and machine learning is the determination of network structure from data. We consider the case where the structure of the graph to be reconstructed is known to be scale-free. We show that in such cases it is natural to formulate structured sparsity inducing priors using submodular functions, and we use their Lovasz extension to obtain a convex relaxation. For tractable classes such as Gaussian graphical models, this leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. We show that our method results in an improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed networks for synthetic data. We also show how our prior encourages scale-free reconstructions on a bioinfomatics dataset.

    * Publisher: NeurIPS
    * Publication Date: `2012`
    * Authors: Qirong Ho, Junming Yin, Eric Xing
    * Abstract: In this paper, we argue for representing networks as a bag of {\it triangular motifs}, particularly for important network problems that current model-based approaches handle poorly due to computational bottlenecks incurred by using edge representations. Such approaches require both 1-edges and 0-edges (missing edges) to be provided as input, and as a consequence, approximate inference algorithms for these models usually require $\Omega(N^2)$ time per iteration, precluding their application to larger real-world networks. In contrast, triangular modeling requires less computation, while providing equivalent or better inference quality. A triangular motif is a vertex triple containing 2 or 3 edges, and the number of such motifs is $\Theta(\sum_{i}D_{i}^{2})$ (where $D_i$ is the degree of vertex $i$), which is much smaller than $N^2$ for low-maximum-degree networks. Using this representation, we develop a novel mixed-membership network model and approximate inference algorithm suitable for large networks with low max-degree. For networks with high maximum degree, the triangular motifs can be naturally subsampled in a {\it node-centric} fashion, allowing for much faster inference at a small cost in accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach, when compared to that of an edge-based model, has faster runtime and improved accuracy for mixed-membership community detection. We conclude with a large-scale demonstration on an $N\approx 280,000$-node network, which is infeasible for network models with $\Omega(N^2)$ inference cost.

The domain knowledge is given as a weighted graph, or a kernel matrix, that loosely indicates which states should have similar optimal actions. We first introduce a bias into the policy search process by deriving a distribution on policies such that policies that disagree with the provided graph have low probabilities. This distribution corresponds to a Markov Random Field. We then present a reinforcement and an apprenticeship learning algorithms for finding such policy distributions. We also illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach on three problems: swing-up cart-balancing with nonuniform and smooth frictions, gridworlds, and teaching a robot to grasp new objects.

    * Abstract: Probabilistic approaches to computer vision typically assume a centralized setting, with the algorithm granted access to all observed data points. However, many problems in wide-area surveillance can benefit from distributed modeling, either because of physical or computational constraints. Most distributed models to date use algebraic approaches (such as distributed SVD) and as a result cannot explicitly deal with missing data. In this work we present an approach to estimation and learning of generative probabilistic models in a distributed context where certain sensor data can be missing. In particular, we show how traditional centralized models, such as probabilistic PCA and missing-data PPCA, can be learned when the data is distributed across a network of sensors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on the problem of distributed affine structure from motion. Our experiments suggest that the accuracy of the learned probabilistic structure and motion models rivals that of traditional centralized factorization methods while being able to handle challenging situations such as missing or noisy observations.

    * Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fast and popular algorithm for finding clusters in networks. Recently, Chaudhuri et al. and Amini et al. proposed variations on the algorithm that artificially inflate the node degrees for improved statistical performance. The current paper extends the previous theoretical results to the more canonical spectral clustering algorithm in a way that removes any assumption on the minimum degree and provides guidance on the choice of tuning parameter. Moreover, our results show how the star shape" in the eigenvectors--which are consistently observed in empirical networks--can be explained by the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel and the Extended Planted Partition model, two statistical model that allow for highly heterogeneous degrees. Throughout, the paper characterizes and justifies several of the variations of the spectral clustering algorithm in terms of these models.

    * Abstract: Multi-armed bandit problems are receiving a great deal of attention because they adequately formalize the exploration-exploitation trade-offs arising in several industrially relevant applications, such as online advertisement and, more generally, recommendation systems. In many cases, however, these applications have a strong social component, whose integration in the bandit algorithm could lead to a dramatic performance increase. For instance, we may want to serve content to a group of users by taking advantage of an underlying network of social relationships among them. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithmic approaches to the solution of such networked bandit problems. More specifically, we design and analyze a global strategy which allocates a bandit algorithm to each network node (user) and allows it to “share” signals (contexts and payoffs) with the neghboring nodes. We then derive two more scalable variants of this strategy based on different ways of clustering the graph nodes. We experimentally compare the algorithm and its variants to state-of-the-art methods for contextual bandits that do not use the relational information. Our experiments, carried out on synthetic and real-world datasets, show a marked increase in prediction performance obtained by exploiting the network structure.

    * Abstract: The l1-regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been shown to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering a sparse inverse covariance matrix even under high-dimensional settings. However, it requires solving a difficult non-smooth log-determinant program with number of parameters scaling quadratically with the number of Gaussian variables. State-of-the-art methods thus do not scale to problems with more than 20,000 variables. In this paper, we develop an algorithm BigQUIC, which can solve 1 million dimensional l1-regularized Gaussian MLE problems (which would thus have 1000 billion parameters) using a single machine, with bounded memory. In order to do so, we carefully exploit the underlying structure of the problem. Our innovations include a novel block-coordinate descent method with the blocks chosen via a clustering scheme to minimize repeated computations; and allowing for inexact computation of specific components. In spite of these modifications, we are able to theoretically analyze our procedure and show that BigQUIC can achieve super-linear or even quadratic convergence rates.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions using the CLIME estimator, which has several desirable theoretical properties. We present an inexact alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm for CLIME, and establish rates of convergence for both the objective and optimality conditions. Further, we develop a large scale distributed framework for the computations, which scales to millions of dimensions and trillions of parameters, using hundreds of cores. The proposed framework solves CLIME in column-blocks and only involves elementwise operations and parallel matrix multiplications. We evaluate our algorithm on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures, which can use block cyclic distribution of data and parameters to achieve load balance and improve the efficiency in the use of memory hierarchies. Experimental results show that our algorithm is substantially more scalable than state-of-the-art methods and scales almost linearly with the number of cores.

In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution defined over a high-dimensional discrete set, specified for instance by a graphical model. We propose a sampling algorithm, called PAWS, based on embedding the set into a higher-dimensional space which is then randomly projected using universal hash functions to a lower-dimensional subspace and explored using combinatorial search methods. Our scheme can leverage fast combinatorial optimization tools as a blackbox and, unlike MCMC methods, samples produced are guaranteed to be within an (arbitrarily small) constant factor of the true probability distribution. We demonstrate that by using state-of-the-art combinatorial search tools, PAWS can efficiently sample from Ising grids with strong interactions and from software verification instances, while MCMC and variational methods fail in both cases.

    * Abstract: While graphs with continuous node attributes arise in many applications, state-of-the-art graph kernels for comparing continuous-attributed graphs suffer from a high runtime complexity; for instance, the popular shortest path kernel scales as $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. In this paper, we present a class of path kernels with computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2 (m + \delta^2))$, where $\delta$ is the graph diameter and $m$ the number of edges. Due to the sparsity and small diameter of real-world graphs, these kernels scale comfortably to large graphs. In our experiments, the presented kernels outperform state-of-the-art kernels in terms of speed and accuracy on classification benchmark datasets.

    * Abstract: We study the complexity of functions computable by deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations in terms of the symmetries and the number of linear regions that they have. Deep networks are able to sequentially map portions of each layer's input-space to the same output. In this way, deep models compute functions that react equally to complicated patterns of different inputs. The compositional structure of these functions enables them to re-use pieces of computation exponentially often in terms of the network's depth. This paper investigates the complexity of such compositional maps and contributes new theoretical results regarding the advantage of depth for neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In particular, our analysis is not specific to a single family of models, and as an example, we employ it for rectifier and maxout networks. We improve complexity bounds from pre-existing work and investigate the behavior of units in higher layers.

We formulate the problem as a constrained submodular optimization problem and demonstrate the benefits of the discovered configurations in remedying mislocalizations and finding informative positive and negative training examples. Together, these lead to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised detection results on the challenging PASCAL VOC dataset.

We establish sufficient conditions for the concavity of our reweighted objective function in terms of weight assignments in the Kikuchi expansion, and show that a reweighted version of the sum product algorithm applied to the Kikuchi region graph will produce global optima of the Kikuchi approximation whenever the algorithm converges. When the region graph has two layers, corresponding to a Bethe approximation, we show that our sufficient conditions for concavity are also necessary. Finally, we provide an explicit characterization of the polytope of concavity in terms of the cycle structure of the region graph. We conclude with simulations that demonstrate the advantages of the reweighted Kikuchi approach.

    * Authors: Eran Treister, Javier S. Turek
    * Abstract: The sparse inverse covariance estimation problem arises in many statistical applications in machine learning and signal processing. In this problem, the inverse of a covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution is estimated, assuming that it is sparse. An $\ell_1$ regularized log-determinant optimization problem is typically solved to approximate such matrices. Because of memory limitations, most existing algorithms are unable to handle large scale instances of this problem. In this paper we present a new block-coordinate descent approach for solving the problem for large-scale data sets. Our method treats the sought matrix block-by-block using quadratic approximations, and we show that this approach has advantages over existing methods in several aspects. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real gene expression data demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state of the art methods, especially for large-scale problems.

    * Abstract: Spectral clustering is a standard approach to label nodes on a graph by studying the (largest or lowest) eigenvalues of a symmetric real matrix such as e.g. the adjacency or the Laplacian. Recently, it has been argued that using instead a more complicated, non-symmetric and higher dimensional operator, related to the non-backtracking walk on the graph, leads to improved performance in detecting clusters, and even to optimal performance for the stochastic block model. Here, we propose to use instead a simpler object, a symmetric real matrix known as the Bethe Hessian operator, or deformed Laplacian. We show that this approach combines the performances of the non-backtracking operator, thus detecting clusters all the way down to the theoretical limit in the stochastic block model, with the computational, theoretical and memory advantages of real symmetric matrices.

    * Abstract: Motivated by generating personalized recommendations using ordinal (or preference) data, we study the question of learning a mixture of MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model, a parameterized class of distributions over permutations, from partial ordinal or preference data (e.g. pair-wise comparisons). Despite its long standing importance across disciplines including social choice, operations research and revenue management, little is known about this question. In case of single MNL models (no mixture), computationally and statistically tractable learning from pair-wise comparisons is feasible. However, even learning mixture of two MNL model is infeasible in general. Given this state of affairs, we seek conditions under which it is feasible to learn the mixture model in both computationally and statistically efficient manner. To that end, we present a sufficient condition as well as an efficient algorithm for learning mixed MNL models from partial preferences/comparisons data. In particular, a mixture of $r$ MNL components over $n$ objects can be learnt using samples whose size scales polynomially in $n$ and $r$ (concretely, $n^3 r^{3.5} \log^4 n$, with $r \ll n^{2/7}$ when the model parameters are sufficiently {\em incoherent}). The algorithm has two phases: first, learn the pair-wise marginals for each component using tensor decomposition; second, learn the model parameters for each component using RankCentrality introduced by Negahban et al. In the process of proving these results, we obtain a generalization of existing analysis for tensor decomposition to a more realistic regime where only partial information about each sample is available.

    * Authors: Se-Young Yun, marc lelarge, Alexandre Proutiere
    * Abstract: In this paper, we consider sparse networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping communities, i.e. disjoint clusters, so that there is higher density within clusters than across clusters. Both the intra- and inter-cluster edge densities vanish when the size of the graph grows large, making the cluster reconstruction problem nosier and hence difficult to solve. We are interested in scenarios where the network size is very large, so that the adjacency matrix of the graph is hard to manipulate and store. The data stream model in which columns of the adjacency matrix are revealed sequentially constitutes a natural framework in this setting. For this model, we develop two novel clustering algorithms that extract the clusters asymptotically accurately. The first algorithm is {\it offline}, as it needs to store and keep the assignments of nodes to clusters, and requires a memory that scales linearly with the network size. The second algorithm is {\it online}, as it may classify a node when the corresponding column is revealed and then discard this information. This algorithm requires a memory growing sub-linearly with the network size. To construct these efficient streaming memory-limited clustering algorithms, we first address the problem of clustering with partial information, where only a small proportion of the columns of the adjacency matrix is observed and develop, for this setting, a new spectral algorithm which is of independent interest.

    * Authors: Adrian Weller, Tony Jebara
    * Abstract: It was recently proved using graph covers (Ruozzi, 2012) that the Bethe partition function is upper bounded by the true partition function for a binary pairwise model that is attractive. Here we provide a new, arguably simpler proof from first principles. We make use of the idea of clamping a variable to a particular value. For an attractive model, we show that summing over the Bethe partition functions for each sub-model obtained after clamping any variable can only raise (and hence improve) the approximation. In fact, we derive a stronger result that may have other useful implications. Repeatedly clamping until we obtain a model with no cycles, where the Bethe approximation is exact, yields the result. We also provide a related lower bound on a broad class of approximate partition functions of general pairwise multi-label models that depends only on the topology. We demonstrate that clamping a few wisely chosen variables can be of practical value by dramatically reducing approximation error.

We evaluate the algorithm on standard random graph benchmarks, including some overlapping community benchmarks, and find its performance to be better or at least as good as previously known algorithms. We also prove a linear time (in number of edges) guarantee for the algorithm on a $p,q$-stochastic block model with where $p \geq c\cdot N^{-\half + \epsilon}$ and $p-q \geq c' \sqrt{p N^{-\half + \epsilon} \log N}$.

    * Abstract: Given a similarity graph between items, correlation clustering (CC) groups similar items together and dissimilar ones apart. One of the most popular CC algorithms is KwikCluster: an algorithm that serially clusters neighborhoods of vertices, and obtains a 3-approximation ratio. Unfortunately, in practice KwikCluster requires a large number of clustering rounds, a potential bottleneck for large graphs.We present C4 and ClusterWild!, two algorithms for parallel correlation clustering that run in a polylogarithmic number of rounds, and provably achieve nearly linear speedups. C4 uses concurrency control to enforce serializability of a parallel clustering process, and guarantees a 3-approximation ratio. ClusterWild! is a coordination free algorithm that abandons consistency for the benefit of better scaling; this leads to a provably small loss in the 3 approximation ratio.We provide extensive experimental results for both algorithms, where we outperform the state of the art, both in terms of clustering accuracy and running time. We show that our algorithms can cluster billion-edge graphs in under 5 seconds on 32 cores, while achieving a 15x speedup.

    * Abstract: We design an online algorithm to classify the vertices of a graph. Underpinning the algorithm is the probability distribution of an Ising model isomorphic to the graph. Each classification is based on predicting the label with maximum marginal probability in the limit of zero-temperature with respect to the labels and vertices seen so far. Computing these classifications is unfortunately based on a $\#P$-complete problem. This motivates us to develop an algorithm for which we give a sequential guarantee in the online mistake bound framework. Our algorithm is optimal when the graph is a tree matching the prior results in [1].For a general graph, the algorithm exploits the additional connectivity over a tree to provide a per-cluster bound. The algorithm is efficient as the cumulative time to sequentially predict all of the vertices of the graph is quadratic in the size of the graph.

    * Abstract: Causal structure learning from time series data is a major scientific challenge. Existing algorithms assume that measurements occur sufficiently quickly; more precisely, they assume that the system and measurement timescales are approximately equal. In many scientific domains, however, measurements occur at a significantly slower rate than the underlying system changes. Moreover, the size of the mismatch between timescales is often unknown. This paper provides three distinct causal structure learning algorithms, all of which discover all dynamic graphs that could explain the observed measurement data as arising from undersampling at some rate. That is, these algorithms all learn causal structure without assuming any particular relation between the measurement and system timescales; they are thus rate-agnostic. We apply these algorithms to data from simulations. The results provide insight into the challenge of undersampling.

    * Abstract: Calcium imaging is an important technique for monitoring the activity of thousands of neurons simultaneously. As calcium imaging datasets grow in size, automated detection of individual neurons is becoming important. Here we apply a supervised learning approach to this problem and show that convolutional networks can achieve near-human accuracy and superhuman speed. Accuracy is superior to the popular PCA/ICA method based on precision and recall relative to ground truth annotation by a human expert. These results suggest that convolutional networks are an efficient and flexible tool for the analysis of large-scale calcium imaging data.

    * Abstract: Influence maximization in social networks has typically been studied in the context of contagion models and irreversible processes. In this paper, we consider an alternate model that treats individual opinions as spins in an Ising system at dynamic equilibrium. We formalize the \textit{Ising influence maximization} problem, which has a natural physical interpretation as maximizing the magnetization given a budget of external magnetic field. Under the mean-field (MF) approximation, we present a gradient ascent algorithm that uses the susceptibility to efficiently calculate local maxima of the magnetization, and we develop a number of sufficient conditions for when the MF magnetization is concave and our algorithm converges to a global optimum. We apply our algorithm on random and real-world networks, demonstrating, remarkably, that the MF optimal external fields (i.e., the external fields which maximize the MF magnetization) exhibit a phase transition from focusing on high-degree individuals at high temperatures to focusing on low-degree individuals at low temperatures. We also establish a number of novel results about the structure of steady-states in the ferromagnetic MF Ising model on general graphs, which are of independent interest.

    * Abstract: Spreading processes are often modelled as a stochastic dynamics occurring on top of a given network with edge weights corresponding to the transmission probabilities. Knowledge of veracious transmission probabilities is essential for prediction, optimization, and control of diffusion dynamics. Unfortunately, in most cases the transmission rates are unknown and need to be reconstructed from the spreading data. Moreover, in realistic settings it is impossible to monitor the state of each node at every time, and thus the data is highly incomplete. We introduce an efficient dynamic message-passing algorithm, which is able to reconstruct parameters of the spreading model given only partial information on the activation times of nodes in the network. The method is generalizable to a large class of dynamic models, as well to the case of temporal graphs.

    * Abstract: We study the problem of 3D object generation. We propose a novel framework, namely 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN), which generates 3D objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging recent advances in volumetric convolutional networks and generative adversarial nets. The benefits of our model are three-fold: first, the use of an adversarial criterion, instead of traditional heuristic criteria, enables the generator to capture object structure implicitly and to synthesize high-quality 3D objects; second, the generator establishes a mapping from a low-dimensional probabilistic space to the space of 3D objects, so that we can sample objects without a reference image or CAD models, and explore the 3D object manifold; third, the adversarial discriminator provides a powerful 3D shape descriptor which, learned without supervision, has wide applications in 3D object recognition. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality 3D objects, and our unsupervisedly learned features achieve impressive performance on 3D object recognition, comparable with those of supervised learning methods.

    * Abstract: We present a novel framework, called GRAB (GRaphical models with overlApping Blocks), to capture densely connected components in a network estimate. GRAB takes as input a data matrix of p variables and n samples, and jointly learns both a network among p variables and densely connected groups of variables (called `blocks'). GRAB has four major novelties as compared to existing network estimation methods: 1) It does not require the blocks to be given a priori. 2) Blocks can overlap. 3) It can jointly learn a network structure and overlapping blocks. 4) It solves a joint optimization problem with the block coordinate descent method that is convex in each step. We show that GRAB reveals the underlying network structure substantially better than four state-of-the-art competitors on synthetic data. When applied to cancer gene expression data, GRAB outperforms its competitors in revealing known functional gene sets and potentially novel genes that drive cancer.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of building continuous occupancy representations in dynamic environments for robotics applications. The problem has hardly been discussed previously due to the complexity of patterns in urban environments, which have both spatial and temporal dependencies. We address the problem as learning a kernel classifier on an efficient feature space. The key novelty of our approach is the incorporation of variations in the time domain into the spatial domain. We propose a method to propagate motion uncertainty into the kernel using a hierarchical model. The main benefit of this approach is that it can directly predict the occupancy state of the map in the future from past observations, being a valuable tool for robot trajectory planning under uncertainty. Our approach preserves the main computational benefits of static Hilbert maps — using stochastic gradient descent for fast optimization of model parameters and incremental updates as new data are captured. Experiments conducted in road intersections of an urban environment demonstrated that spatio-temporal Hilbert maps can accurately model changes in the map while outperforming other techniques on various aspects.

    * Abstract: Signed networks allow to model positive and negative relationships. We analyze existing extensions of spectral clustering to signed networks. It turns out that existing approaches do not recover the ground truth clustering in several situations where either the positive or the negative network structures contain no noise. Our analysis shows that these problems arise as existing approaches take some form of arithmetic mean of the Laplacians of the positive and negative part. As a solution we propose to use the geometric mean of the Laplacians of positive and negative part and show that it outperforms the existing approaches. While the geometric mean of matrices is computationally expensive, we show that eigenvectors of the geometric mean can be computed efficiently, leading to a numerical scheme for sparse matrices which is of independent interest.

    * Authors: Ilya Shpitser
    * Abstract: Missing records are a perennial problem in analysis of complex data of all types, when the target of inference is some function of the full data law. In simple cases, where data is missing at random or completely at random (Rubin, 1976), well-known adjustments exist that result in consistent estimators of target quantities. Assumptions underlying these estimators are generally not realistic in practical missing data problems. Unfortunately, consistent estimators in more complex cases where data is missing not at random, and where no ordering on variables induces monotonicity of missingness status are not known in general, with some notable exceptions (Robins, 1997), (Tchetgen Tchetgen et al, 2016), (Sadinle and Reiter, 2016). In this paper, we propose a general class of consistent estimators for cases where data is missing not at random, and missingness status is non-monotonic. Our estimators, which are generalized inverse probability weighting estimators, make no assumptions on the underlying full data law, but instead place independence restrictions, and certain other fairly mild assumptions, on the distribution of missingness status conditional on the data. The assumptions we place on the distribution of missingness status conditional on the data can be viewed as a version of a conditional Markov random field (MRF) corresponding to a chain graph. Assumptions embedded in our model permit identification from the observed data law, and admit a natural fitting procedure based on the pseudo likelihood approach of (Besag, 1975). We illustrate our approach with a simple simulation study, and an analysis of risk of premature birth in women in Botswana exposed to highly active anti-retroviral therapy.

    * Abstract: We propose and study a new class of submodular functions called deep submodular functions (DSFs). We define DSFs and situate them within the broader context of classes of submodular functions in relationship both to various matroid ranks and sums of concave composed with modular functions (SCMs). Notably, we find that DSFs constitute a strictly broader class than SCMs, thus motivating their use, but that they do not comprise all submodular functions. Interestingly, some DSFs can be seen as special cases of certain deep neural networks (DNNs), hence the name. Finally, we provide a method to learn DSFs in a max-margin framework, and offer preliminary results applying this both to synthetic and real-world data instances.

    * Authors: Mark Rowland, Adrian Weller
    * Abstract: The idea of uprooting and rerooting graphical models was introduced specifically for binary pairwise models by Weller (2016) as a way to transform a model to any of a whole equivalence class of related models, such that inference on any one model yields inference results for all others. This is very helpful since inference, or relevant bounds, may be much easier to obtain or more accurate for some model in the class. Here we introduce methods to extend the approach to models with higher-order potentials and develop theoretical insights. In particular, we show that the triplet-consistent polytope TRI is unique in being `universally rooted'. We demonstrate empirically that rerooting can significantly improve accuracy of methods of inference for higher-order models at negligible computational cost.

    * Abstract: Source coding is the canonical problem of data compression in information theory. In a locally encodable source coding, each compressed bit depends on only few bits of the input. In this paper, we show that a recently popular model of semisupervised clustering is equivalent to locally encodable source coding. In this model, the task is to perform multiclass labeling of unlabeled elements. At the beginning, we can ask in parallel a set of simple queries to an oracle who provides (possibly erroneous) binary answers to the queries. The queries cannot involve more than two (or a fixed constant number $\Delta$ of) elements. Now the labeling of all the elements (or clustering) must be performed based on the (noisy) query answers. The goal is to recover all the correct labelings while minimizing the number of such queries. The equivalence to locally encodable source codes leads us to find lower bounds on the number of queries required in variety of scenarios. We are also able to show fundamental limitations of pairwise `same cluster' queries - and propose pairwise AND queries, that provably performs better in many situations.

    * Abstract: Existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are either based on general-purpose and domain-agnostic schemes, which can lead to slow convergence, or require hand-crafting of problem-specific proposals by an expert. We propose A-NICE-MC, a novel method to train flexible parametric Markov chain kernels to produce samples with desired properties. First, we propose an efficient likelihood-free adversarial training method to train a Markov chain and mimic a given data distribution. Then, we leverage flexible volume preserving flows to obtain parametric kernels for MCMC. Using a bootstrap approach, we show how to train efficient Markov Chains to sample from a prescribed posterior distribution by iteratively improving the quality of both the model and the samples. A-NICE-MC provides the first framework to automatically design efficient domain-specific MCMC proposals. Empirical results demonstrate that A-NICE-MC combines the strong guarantees of MCMC with the expressiveness of deep neural networks, and is able to significantly outperform competing methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

    * Publication Date: `2017`
    * Authors: Daniil Ryabko
    * Abstract: The independence clustering problem is considered in the following formulation: given a set $S$ of random variables, it is required to find the finest partitioning $\{U_1,\dots,U_k\}$ of $S$ into clusters such that the clusters $U_1,\dots,U_k$ are mutually independent. Since mutual independence is the target, pairwise similarity measurements are of no use, and thus traditional clustering algorithms are inapplicable. The distribution of the random variables in $S$ is, in general, unknown, but a sample is available. Thus, the problem is cast in terms of time series. Two forms of sampling are considered: i.i.d.\ and stationary time series, with the main emphasis being on the latter, more general, case. A consistent, computationally tractable algorithm for each of the settings is proposed, and a number of fascinating open directions for further research are outlined.

    * Abstract: Aggregative games provide a rich abstraction to model strategic multi-agent interactions. We focus on learning local aggregative games, where the payoff of each player is a function of its own action and the aggregate behavior of its neighbors in a connected digraph. We show the existence of a pure strategy epsilon-Nash equilibrium in such games when the payoff functions are convex or sub-modular. We prove an information theoretic lower bound, in a value oracle model, on approximating the structure of the digraph with non-negative monotone sub-modular cost functions on the edge set cardinality. We also introduce gamma-aggregative games that generalize local aggregative games, and admit epsilon-Nash equilibrium that are stable with respect to small changes in some specified graph property. Moreover, we provide estimation algorithms for the game theoretic model that can meaningfully recover the underlying structure and payoff functions from real voting data.

    * Abstract: We define and study error detection and correction tasks that are useful for 3D reconstruction of neurons from electron microscopic imagery, and for image segmentation more generally. Both tasks take as input the raw image and a binary mask representing a candidate object. For the error detection task, the desired output is a map of split and merge errors in the object. For the error correction task, the desired output is the true object. We call this object mask pruning, because the candidate object mask is assumed to be a superset of the true object. We train multiscale 3D convolutional networks to perform both tasks. We find that the error-detecting net can achieve high accuracy. The accuracy of the error-correcting net is enhanced if its input object mask is ``advice'' (union of erroneous objects) from the error-detecting net.

    * Abstract: We study the basic problem of learning overcomplete HMMs---those that have many hidden states but a small output alphabet. Despite having significant practical importance, such HMMs are poorly understood with no known positive or negative results for efficient learning. In this paper, we present several new results---both positive and negative---which help define the boundaries between the tractable-learning setting and the intractable setting. We show positive results for a large subclass of HMMs whose transition matrices are sparse, well-conditioned and have small probability mass on short cycles. We also show that learning is impossible given only a polynomial number of samples for HMMs with a small output alphabet and whose transition matrices are random regular graphs with large degree. We also discuss these results in the context of learning HMMs which can capture long-term dependencies.

    * Abstract: Abstraction and realization are bilateral processes that are key in deriving intelligence and creativity. In many domains, the two processes are approached through \emph{rules}: high-level principles that reveal invariances within similar yet diverse examples. Under a probabilistic setting for discrete input spaces, we focus on the rule realization problem which generates input sample distributions that follow the given rules. More ambitiously, we go beyond a mechanical realization that takes whatever is given, but instead ask for proactively selecting reasonable rules to realize. This goal is demanding in practice, since the initial rule set may not always be consistent and thus intelligent compromises are needed. We formulate both rule realization and selection as two strongly connected components within a single and symmetric bi-convex problem, and derive an efficient algorithm that works at large scale. Taking music compositional rules as the main example throughout the paper, we demonstrate our model's efficiency in not only music realization (composition) but also music interpretation and understanding (analysis).

    * Abstract: Singular values of a data in a matrix form provide insights on the structure of the data, the effective dimensionality, and the choice of hyper-parameters on higher-level data analysis tools. However, in many practical applications such as collaborative filtering and network analysis, we only get a partial observation. Under such scenarios, we consider the fundamental problem of recovering various spectral properties of the underlying matrix from a sampling of its entries. We propose a framework of first estimating the Schatten $k$-norms of a matrix for several values of $k$, and using these as surrogates for estimating spectral properties of interest, such as the spectrum itself or the rank. This paper focuses on the technical challenges in accurately estimating the Schatten norms from a sampling of a matrix. We introduce a novel unbiased estimator based on counting small structures in a graph and provide guarantees that match its empirical performances. Our theoretical analysis shows that Schatten norms can be recovered accurately from strictly smaller number of samples compared to what is needed to recover the underlying low-rank matrix. Numerical experiments suggest that we significantly improve upon a competing approach of using matrix completion methods.

In particular, our bounds exploit nonbacktracking walks, Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre type inequalities, and are computed by message passing algorithms. Nonbacktracking walks have recently allowed for headways in community detection, and this paper shows that their use can also impact the influence computation. Further, we provide parameterized versions of the bounds that control the trade-off between the efficiency and the accuracy. Finally, the tightness of the bounds is illustrated with simulations on various network models.

    * Abstract: Learning the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of a Bayesian network from observational data is a notoriously difficult problem for which many non-identifiability and hardness results are known. In this paper we propose a provably polynomial-time algorithm for learning sparse Gaussian Bayesian networks with equal noise variance --- a class of Bayesian networks for which the DAG structure can be uniquely identified from observational data --- under high-dimensional settings. We show that $O(k^4 \log p)$ number of samples suffices for our method to recover the true DAG structure with high probability, where $p$ is the number of variables and $k$ is the maximum Markov blanket size. We obtain our theoretical guarantees under a condition called \emph{restricted strong adjacency faithfulness} (RSAF), which is strictly weaker than strong faithfulness --- a condition that other methods based on conditional independence testing need for their success. The sample complexity of our method matches the information-theoretic limits in terms of the dependence on $p$. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments.

    * Abstract: Hypergraph partitioning is an important problem in machine learning, computer vision and network analytics. A widely used method for hypergraph partitioning relies on minimizing a normalized sum of the costs of partitioning hyperedges across clusters. Algorithmic solutions based on this approach assume that different partitions of a hyperedge incur the same cost. However, this assumption fails to leverage the fact that different subsets of vertices within the same hyperedge may have different structural importance. We hence propose a new hypergraph clustering technique, termed inhomogeneous hypergraph partitioning, which assigns different costs to different hyperedge cuts. We prove that inhomogeneous partitioning produces a quadratic approximation to the optimal solution if the inhomogeneous costs satisfy submodularity constraints. Moreover, we demonstrate that inhomogenous partitioning offers significant performance improvements in applications such as structure learning of rankings, subspace segmentation and motif clustering.

    * Abstract: Storing data in synthetic DNA offers the possibility of improving information density and durability by several orders of magnitude compared to current storage technologies. However, DNA data storage requires a computationally intensive process to retrieve the data. In particular, a crucial step in the data retrieval pipeline involves clustering billions of strings with respect to edit distance. Datasets in this domain have many notable properties, such as containing a very large number of small clusters that are well-separated in the edit distance metric space. In this regime, existing algorithms are unsuitable because of either their long running time or low accuracy. To address this issue, we present a novel distributed algorithm for approximately computing the underlying clusters. Our algorithm converges efficiently on any dataset that satisfies certain separability properties, such as those coming from DNA data storage systems. We also prove that, under these assumptions, our algorithm is robust to outliers and high levels of noise. We provide empirical justification of the accuracy, scalability, and convergence of our algorithm on real and synthetic data. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for clustering DNA sequences, our algorithm simultaneously achieves higher accuracy and a 1000x speedup on three real datasets.

In essence, it combines the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and reverse KL divergences into a unified objective function, thus it exploits the complementary statistical properties from these divergences to effectively diversify the estimated density in capturing multi-modes. We term our method dual discriminator generative adversarial nets (D2GAN) which, unlike GAN, has two discriminators; and together with a generator, it also has the analogy of a minimax game, wherein a discriminator rewards high scores for samples from data distribution whilst another discriminator, conversely, favoring data from the generator, and the generator produces data to fool both two discriminators. We develop theoretical analysis to show that, given the maximal discriminators, optimizing the generator of D2GAN reduces to minimizing both KL and reverse KL divergences between data distribution and the distribution induced from the data generated by the generator, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapsing problem. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world large-scale datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, ImageNet), where we have made our best effort to compare our D2GAN with the latest state-of-the-art GAN's variants in comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive and superior performance of our approach in generating good quality and diverse samples over baselines, and the capability of our method to scale up to ImageNet database.

    * Abstract: This paper introduces the QMDP-net, a neural network architecture for planning under partial observability. The QMDP-net combines the strengths of model-free learning and model-based planning. It is a recurrent policy network, but it represents a policy for a parameterized set of tasks by connecting a model with a planning algorithm that solves the model, thus embedding the solution structure of planning in a network learning architecture. The QMDP-net is fully differentiable and allows for end-to-end training. We train a QMDP-net on different tasks so that it can generalize to new ones in the parameterized task set and “transfer” to other similar tasks beyond the set. In preliminary experiments, QMDP-net showed strong performance on several robotic tasks in simulation. Interestingly, while QMDP-net encodes the QMDP algorithm, it sometimes outperforms the QMDP algorithm in the experiments, as a result of end-to-end learning.

    * Abstract: We demonstrate that a very deep ResNet with stacked modules that have one neuron per hidden layer and ReLU activation functions can uniformly approximate any Lebesgue integrable function in d dimensions, i.e. \ell_1(R^d). Due to the identity mapping inherent to ResNets, our network has alternating layers of dimension one and d. This stands in sharp contrast to fully connected networks, which are not universal approximators if their width is the input dimension d [21,11]. Hence, our result implies an increase in representational power for narrow deep networks by the ResNet architecture.

    * Authors: Jeffrey Pennington, Pratik Worah
    * Abstract: An important factor contributing to the success of deep learning has been the remarkable ability to optimize large neural networks using simple first-order optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. While the efficiency of such methods depends crucially on the local curvature of the loss surface, very little is actually known about how this geometry depends on network architecture and hyperparameters. In this work, we extend a recently-developed framework for studying spectra of nonlinear random matrices to characterize an important measure of curvature, namely the eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix. We focus on a single-hidden-layer neural network with Gaussian data and weights and provide an exact expression for the spectrum in the limit of infinite width. We find that linear networks suffer worse conditioning than nonlinear networks and that nonlinear networks are generically non-degenerate. We also predict and demonstrate empirically that by adjusting the nonlinearity, the spectrum can be tuned so as to improve the efficiency of first-order optimization methods.

    * Abstract: Digital presence in the world of online social media entails significant privacy risks. In this work we consider a privacy threat to a social network in which an attacker has access to a subset of random walk-based node similarities, such as effective resistances (i.e., commute times) or personalized PageRank scores. Using these similarities, the attacker seeks to infer as much information as possible about the network, including unknown pairwise node similarities and edges. For the effective resistance metric, we show that with just a small subset of measurements, one can learn a large fraction of edges in a social network. We also show that it is possible to learn a graph which accurately matches the underlying network on all other effective resistances. This second observation is interesting from a data mining perspective, since it can be expensive to compute all effective resistances or other random walk-based similarities. As an alternative, our graphs learned from just a subset of effective resistances can be used as surrogates in a range of applications that use effective resistances to probe graph structure, including for graph clustering, node centrality evaluation, and anomaly detection. We obtain our results by formalizing the graph learning objective mathematically, using two optimization problems. One formulation is convex and can be solved provably in polynomial time. The other is not, but we solve it efficiently with projected gradient and coordinate descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on a number of social networks obtained from Facebook. We also discuss how our methods can be generalized to other random walk-based similarities, such as personalized PageRank scores.

    * Abstract: Kleinberg (2002) stated three axioms that any clustering procedure should satisfy and showed there is no clustering procedure that simultaneously satisfies all three. One of these, called the consistency axiom, requires that when the data is modified in a helpful way, i.e. if points in the same cluster are made more similar and those in different ones made less similar, the algorithm should output the same clustering. To circumvent this impossibility result, research has focused on considering clustering procedures that have a clustering quality measure (or a cost) and showing that a modification of Kleinberg’s axioms that takes cost into account lead to feasible clustering procedures. In this work, we take a different approach, based on the observation that the consistency axiom fails to be satisfied when the “correct” number of clusters changes. We modify this axiom by making use of cost functions to determine the correct number of clusters, and require that consistency holds only if the number of clusters remains unchanged. We show that single linkage satisfies the modified axioms, and if the input is well-clusterable, some popular procedures such as k-means also satisfy the axioms, taking a step towards explaining the success of these objective functions for guiding the design of algorithms.

    * Abstract: We consider testing and learning problems on causal Bayesian networks as defined by Pearl (Pearl, 2009). Given a causal Bayesian network M on a graph with n discrete variables and bounded in-degree and bounded ``confounded components'', we show that O(log n) interventions on an unknown causal Bayesian network X on the same graph, and O(n/epsilon^2) samples per intervention, suffice to efficiently distinguish whether X=M or whether there exists some intervention under which X and M are farther than epsilon in total variation distance. We also obtain sample/time/intervention efficient algorithms for: (i) testing the identity of two unknown causal Bayesian networks on the same graph; and (ii) learning a causal Bayesian network on a given graph. Although our algorithms are non-adaptive, we show that adaptivity does not help in general: Omega(log n) interventions are necessary for testing the identity of two unknown causal Bayesian networks on the same graph, even adaptively. Our algorithms are enabled by a new subadditivity inequality for the squared Hellinger distance between two causal Bayesian networks.

    * Abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) are now routinely used to summarize the underlying topology of complex data. Despite several appealing properties, incorporating PDs in learning pipelines can be challenging because their natural geometry is not Hilbertian. Indeed, this was recently exemplified in a string of papers which show that the simple task of averaging a few PDs can be computationally prohibitive. We propose in this article a tractable framework to carry out standard tasks on PDs at scale, notably evaluating distances, estimating barycenters and performing clustering. This framework builds upon a reformulation of PD metrics as optimal transport (OT) problems. Doing so, we can exploit recent computational advances: the OT problem on a planar grid, when regularized with entropy, is convex can be solved in linear time using the Sinkhorn algorithm and convolutions. This results in scalable computations that can stream on GPUs. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by carrying out clustering with diagrams metrics on several thousands of PDs, a scale never seen before in the literature.

    * Abstract: Graph convolution is the core of most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and usually approximated by message passing between direct (one-hop) neighbors. In this work, we remove the restriction of using only the direct neighbors by introducing a powerful, yet spatially localized graph convolution: Graph diffusion convolution (GDC). GDC leverages generalized graph diffusion, examples of which are the heat kernel and personalized PageRank. It alleviates the problem of noisy and often arbitrarily defined edges in real graphs. We show that GDC is closely related to spectral-based models and thus combines the strengths of both spatial (message passing) and spectral methods. We demonstrate that replacing message passing with graph diffusion convolution consistently leads to significant performance improvements across a wide range of models on both supervised and unsupervised tasks and a variety of datasets. Furthermore, GDC is not limited to GNNs but can trivially be combined with any graph-based model or algorithm (e.g. spectral clustering) without requiring any changes to the latter or affecting its computational complexity. Our implementation is available online.

    * Abstract: Optimal transport (\OT) theory defines a powerful set of tools to compare probability distributions. \OT~suffers however from a few drawbacks, computational and statistical, which have encouraged the proposal of several regularized variants of OT in the recent literature, one of the most notable being the \textit{sliced} formulation, which exploits the closed-form formula between univariate distributions by projecting high-dimensional measures onto random lines. We consider in this work a more general family of ground metrics, namely \textit{tree metrics}, which also yield fast closed-form computations and negative definite, and of which the sliced-Wasserstein distance is a particular case (the tree is a chain). We propose the tree-sliced Wasserstein distance, computed by averaging the Wasserstein distance between these measures using random tree metrics, built adaptively in either low or high-dimensional spaces. Exploiting the negative definiteness of that distance, we also propose a positive definite kernel, and test it against other baselines on a few benchmark tasks.

    * Abstract: Interest point detection and local feature description are fundamental steps in many computer vision applications. Classical approaches are based on a detect-then-describe paradigm where separate handcrafted methods are used to first identify repeatable keypoints and then represent them with a local descriptor. Neural networks trained with metric learning losses have recently caught up with these techniques, focusing on learning repeatable saliency maps for keypoint detection or learning descriptors at the detected keypoint locations. In this work, we argue that repeatable regions are not necessarily discriminative and can therefore lead to select suboptimal keypoints. Furthermore, we claim that descriptors should be learned only in regions for which matching can be performed with high confidence. We thus propose to jointly learn keypoint detection and description together with a predictor of the local descriptor discriminativeness. This allows to avoid ambiguous areas, thus leading to reliable keypoint detection and description. Our detection-and-description approach simultaneously outputs sparse, repeatable and reliable keypoints that outperforms state-of-the-art detectors and descriptors on the HPatches dataset and on the recent Aachen Day-Night localization benchmark.

    * Abstract: Correlation Clustering is a powerful graph partitioning model that aims to cluster items based on the notion of similarity between items. An instance of the Correlation Clustering problem consists of a graph G (not necessarily complete) whose edges are labeled by a binary classifier as similar and dissimilar. Classically, we are tasked with producing a clustering that minimizes the number of disagreements: an edge is in disagreement if it is a similar edge and is present across clusters or if it is a dissimilar edge and is present within a cluster. Define the disagreements vector to be an n dimensional vector indexed by the vertices, where the v-th index is the number of disagreements at vertex v. Recently, Puleo and Milenkovic (ICML '16) initiated the study of the Correlation Clustering framework in which the objectives were more general functions of the disagreements vector. In this paper, we study algorithms for minimizing \ellq norms (q >= 1) of the disagreements vector for both arbitrary and complete graphs. We present the first known algorithm for minimizing the \ellq norm of the disagreements vector on arbitrary graphs and also provide an improved algorithm for minimizing the \ell_q norm (q >= 1) of the disagreements vector on complete graphs. We also study an alternate cluster-wise local objective introduced by Ahmadi, Khuller and Saha (IPCO '19), which aims to minimize the maximum number of disagreements associated with a cluster. We present an improved (2 + \eps) approximation algorithm for this objective.

    * Abstract: Real-world applications often combine learning and optimization problems on graphs. For instance, our objective may be to cluster the graph in order to detect meaningful communities (or solve other common graph optimization problems such as facility location, maxcut, and so on). However, graphs or related attributes are often only partially observed, introducing learning problems such as link prediction which must be solved prior to optimization. Standard approaches treat learning and optimization entirely separately, while recent machine learning work aims to predict the optimal solution directly from the inputs. Here, we propose an alternative decision-focused learning approach that integrates a differentiable proxy for common graph optimization problems as a layer in learned systems. The main idea is to learn a representation that maps the original optimization problem onto a simpler proxy problem that can be efficiently differentiated through. Experimental results show that our ClusterNet system outperforms both pure end-to-end approaches (that directly predict the optimal solution) and standard approaches that entirely separate learning and optimization. Code for our system is available at https://github.com/bwilder0/clusternet.

Suppose that there is a large set of arms, yet there is a simple but unknown structure amongst the arm reward functions, e.g. finite types or smooth with respect to an unknown metric space. We present a novel algorithm which learns data-driven similarities amongst the arms, in order to implement adaptive partitioning of the context-arm space for more efficient learning. We provide regret bounds along with simulations that highlight the algorithm's dependence on the local geometry of the reward functions.

    * Abstract: In correlation clustering, we are given $n$ objects together with a binary similarity score between each pair of them. The goal is to partition the objects into clusters so to minimise the disagreements with the scores. In this work we investigate correlation clustering as an active learning problem: each similarity score can be learned by making a query, and the goal is to minimise both the disagreements and the total number of queries. On the one hand, we describe simple active learning algorithms, which provably achieve an almost optimal trade-off while giving cluster recovery guarantees, and we test them on different datasets. On the other hand, we prove information-theoretical bounds on the number of queries necessary to guarantee a prescribed disagreement bound. These results give a rich characterization of the trade-off between queries and clustering error.

    * Abstract: Contemporary sensorimotor learning approaches typically start with an existing complex agent (e.g., a robotic arm), which they learn to control. In contrast, this paper investigates a modular co-evolution strategy: a collection of primitive agents learns to dynamically self-assemble into composite bodies while also learning to coordinate their behavior to control these bodies. Each primitive agent consists of a limb with a motor attached at one end. Limbs may choose to link up to form collectives. When a limb initiates a link-up action and there is another limb nearby, the latter is magnetically connected to the 'parent' limb's motor. This forms a new single agent, which may further link with other agents. In this way, complex morphologies can emerge, controlled by a policy whose architecture is in explicit correspondence with the morphology. We evaluate the performance of these dynamic and modular agents in simulated environments. We demonstrate better generalization to test-time changes both in the environment, as well as in the structure of the agent, compared to static and monolithic baselines.

    * Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful tool for machine learning on graphs.GNNs combine node feature information with the graph structure by recursively passing neural messages along edges of the input graph. However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models, and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here we propose GNNExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GNNExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. Further, GNNExplainer can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances. We formulate GNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms baselines by 17.1% on average. GNNExplainer provides a variety of benefits, from the ability to visualize semantically relevant structures to interpretability, to giving insights into errors of faulty GNNs.

Theoretical analyses and empirical studies have pushed forward the translation of discrete graph structures into distributed representation vectors, but seldom considered the reverse direction, i.e., generation of graphs from given related context spaces. Particularly, since graphs often become more meaningful when associated with semantic contexts (e.g., social networks of certain communities, gene networks of certain diseases), the ability to infer graph structures according to given semantic conditions could be of great value. While existing graph generative models only consider graph structures without semantic contexts, we formulate the novel problem of conditional structure generation, and propose a novel unified model of graph variational generative adversarial nets (CondGen) to handle the intrinsic challenges of flexible context-structure conditioning and permutation-invariant generation. Extensive experiments on two deliberately created benchmark datasets of real-world context-enriched networks demonstrate the supreme effectiveness and generalizability of CondGen.

    * Authors: Honghao Li, Vincent Cabeli, Nadir Sella, Herve Isambert
    * Abstract: We consider constraint-based methods for causal structure learning, such as the PC algorithm or any PC-derived algorithms whose ﬁrst step consists in pruning a complete graph to obtain an undirected graph skeleton, which is subsequently oriented. All constraint-based methods perform this ﬁrst step of removing dispensable edges, iteratively, whenever a separating set and corresponding conditional independence can be found. Yet, constraint-based methods lack robustness over sampling noise and are prone to uncover spurious conditional independences in ﬁnite datasets. In particular, there is no guarantee that the separating sets identiﬁed during the iterative pruning step remain consistent with the ﬁnal graph. In this paper, we propose a simple modiﬁcation of PC and PC-derived algorithms so as to ensure that all separating sets identiﬁed to remove dispensable edges are consistent with the ﬁnal graph,thus enhancing the explainability of constraint-basedmethods. It is achieved by repeating the constraint-based causal structure learning scheme, iteratively, while searching for separating sets that are consistent with the graph obtained at the previous iteration. Ensuring the consistency of separating sets can be done at a limited complexity cost, through the use of block-cut tree decomposition of graph skeletons, and is found to increase their validity in terms of actual d-separation. It also signiﬁcantly improves the sensitivity of constraint-based methods while retaining good overall structure learning performance. Finally and foremost, ensuring sepset consistency improves the interpretability of constraint-based models for real-life applications.

    * Abstract: Inspired by recent work in attention models for image captioning and question answering, we present a soft attention model for the reinforcement learning domain. This model bottlenecks the view of an agent by a soft, top-down attention mechanism, forcing the agent to focus on task-relevant information by sequentially querying its view of the environment. The output of the attention mechanism allows direct observation of the information used by the agent to select its actions, enabling easier interpretation of this model than of traditional models. We analyze the different strategies the agents learn and show that a handful of strategies arise repeatedly across different games. We also show that the model learns to query separately about space and content (where'' vs.what''). We demonstrate that an agent using this mechanism can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art models on ATARI tasks while still being interpretable.

    * Abstract: We introduce #opt, a new inference task for graphical models which calls for counting the number of optimal solutions of the model. We describe a novel variable elimination based approach for solving this task, as well as a depth-first branch and bound algorithm that traverses the AND/OR search space of the model. The key feature of the proposed algorithms is that their complexity is exponential in the induced width of the model only. It does not depend on the actual number of optimal solutions. Our empirical evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared with existing depth-first and best-first search based approaches that enumerate explicitly the optimal solutions.

    * Authors: Kunal Talwar
    * Abstract: Two commonly arising computational tasks in Bayesian learning are Optimization (Maximum A Posteriori estimation) and Sampling (from the posterior distribution). In the convex case these two problems are efficiently reducible to each other. Recent work (Ma et al. 2019) shows that in the non-convex case, sampling can sometimes be provably faster. We present a simpler and stronger separation. We then compare sampling and optimization in more detail and show that they are provably incomparable: there are families of continuous functions for which optimization is easy but sampling is NP-hard, and vice versa. Further, we show function families that exhibit a sharp phase transition in the computational complexity of sampling, as one varies the natural temperature parameter. Our results draw on a connection to analogous separations in the discrete setting which are well-studied.

    * Abstract: Recent works in geometric deep learning have introduced neural networks that allow performing inference tasks on three-dimensional geometric data by defining convolution --and sometimes pooling-- operations on triangle meshes. These methods, however, either consider the input mesh as a graph, and do not exploit specific geometric properties of meshes for feature aggregation and downsampling, or are specialized for meshes, but rely on a rigid definition of convolution that does not properly capture the local topology of the mesh. We propose a method that combines the advantages of both types of approaches, while addressing their limitations: we extend a primal-dual framework drawn from the graph-neural-network literature to triangle meshes, and define convolutions on two types of graphs constructed from an input mesh. Our method takes features for both edges and faces of a 3D mesh as input, and dynamically aggregates them using an attention mechanism. At the same time, we introduce a pooling operation with a precise geometric interpretation, that allows handling variations in the mesh connectivity by clustering mesh faces in a task-driven fashion. We provide theoretical insights of our approach using tools from the mesh-simplification literature. In addition, we validate experimentally our method in the tasks of shape classification and shape segmentation, where we obtain comparable or superior performance to the state of the art.

    * Authors: Shuai Li, Fang Kong, Kejie Tang, Qizhi Li, Wei Chen
    * Abstract: Online influence maximization (OIM) is a popular problem in social networks to learn influence propagation model parameters and maximize the influence spread at the same time. Most previous studies focus on the independent cascade (IC) model under the edge-level feedback. In this paper, we address OIM in the linear threshold (LT) model. Because node activations in the LT model are due to the aggregated effect of all active neighbors, it is more natural to model OIM with the nodel-level feedback. And this brings new challenge in online learning since we only observe aggregated effect from groups of nodes and the groups are also random. Based on the linear structure in node activations, we incorporate ideas from linear bandits and design an algorithm $\ltlinucb$ that is consistent with the observed feedback. By proving group observation modulated (GOM) bounded smoothness property, a novel result of the influence difference in terms of the random observations, we provide a regret of order $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(m)\sqrt{T})$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $T$ is the number of rounds. This is the first theoretical result in such order for OIM under the LT model. In the end, we also provide an algorithm $\oimetc$ with regret bound $O(\mathrm{poly}(m)\ T^{2/3})$, which is model-independent, simple and has less requirement on online feedback and offline computation.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fully differentiable pipeline for estimating accurate dense correspondences between 3D point clouds. The proposed pipeline is an extension and a generalization of the functional maps framework. However, instead of using the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions as done in virtually all previous works in this domain, we demonstrate that learning the basis from data can both improve robustness and lead to better accuracy in challenging settings. We interpret the basis as a learned embedding into a higher dimensional space. Following the functional map paradigm the optimal transformation in this embedding space must be linear and we propose a separate architecture aimed at estimating the transformation by learning optimal descriptor functions. This leads to the first end-to-end trainable functional map-based correspondence approach in which both the basis and the descriptors are learned from data. Interestingly, we also observe that learning a canonical embedding leads to worse results, suggesting that leaving an extra linear degree of freedom to the embedding network gives it more robustness, thereby also shedding light onto the success of previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in challenging non-rigid 3D point cloud correspondence applications.

    * Abstract: Modularity maximization has been a fundamental tool for understanding the community structure of a network, but the underlying optimization problem is nonconvex and NP-hard to solve. State-of-the-art algorithms like the Louvain or Leiden methods focus on different heuristics to help escape local optima, but they still depend on a greedy step that moves node assignment locally and is prone to getting trapped. In this paper, we propose a new class of low-cardinality algorithm that generalizes the local update to maximize a semidefinite relaxation derived from max-k-cut. This proposed algorithm is scalable, empirically achieves the global semidefinite optimality for small cases, and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in real-world datasets with little additional time cost. From the algorithmic perspective, it also opens a new avenue for scaling-up semidefinite programming when the solutions are sparse instead of low-rank.

    * Abstract: Instance segmentation, which seeks to obtain both class and instance labels for each pixel in the input image, is a challenging task in computer vision. State-of- the-art algorithms often employ a search-based strategy, which first divides the output image with a regular grid and generate proposals at each grid cell, then the proposals are classified and boundaries refined. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that directly utilizes a fully convolutional network (FCN) to predict instance labels. Specifically, we propose a variational relaxation of instance segmentation as minimizing an optimization functional for a piecewise-constant segmentation problem, which can be used to train an FCN end-to-end. It extends the classical Mumford-Shah variational segmentation algorithm to be able to handle the permutation-invariant ground truth in instance segmentation. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and the MSCOCO 2017 dataset show that the proposed approach efficiently tackles the instance segmentation task.

    * Abstract: Noninvasive behavioral tracking of animals is crucial for many scientific investigations. Recent transfer learning approaches for behavioral tracking have considerably advanced the state of the art. Typically these methods treat each video frame and each object to be tracked independently. In this work, we improve on these methods (particularly in the regime of few training labels) by leveraging the rich spatiotemporal structures pervasive in behavioral video --- specifically, the spatial statistics imposed by physical constraints (e.g., paw to elbow distance), and the temporal statistics imposed by smoothness from frame to frame. We propose a probabilistic graphical model built on top of deep neural networks, Deep Graph Pose (DGP), to leverage these useful spatial and temporal constraints, and develop an efficient structured variational approach to perform inference in this model. The resulting semi-supervised model exploits both labeled and unlabeled frames to achieve significantly more accurate and robust tracking while requiring users to label fewer training frames. In turn, these tracking improvements enhance performance on downstream applications, including robust unsupervised segmentation of behavioral syllables,'' and estimation of interpretabledisentangled'' low-dimensional representations of the full behavioral video.

    * Abstract: Real-world networks, especially the ones that emerge due to actions of animate agents (e.g. humans, animals), are the result of underlying strategic mechanisms aimed at maximizing individual or collective benefits. Learning approaches built to capture these strategic insights would gain interpretability and flexibility benefits that are required to generalize beyond observations. To this end, we consider a game-theoretic formalism of network emergence that accounts for the underlying strategic mechanisms and take it to the observed data. We propose MINE (Multi-agent Inverse models of Network Emergence mechanism), a new learning framework that solves Markov-Perfect network emergence games using multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning. MINE jointly discovers agents' strategy profiles in the form of network emergence policy and the latent payoff mechanism in the form of learned reward function. In the experiments, we demonstrate that MINE learns versatile payoff mechanisms that: highly correlates with the ground truth for a synthetic case; can be used to analyze the observed network structure; and enable effective transfer in specific settings. Further, we show that the network emergence game as a learned model supports meaningful strategic predictions, thereby signifying its applicability to a variety of network analysis tasks.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of learning a sparse graph from the Laplacian constrained Gaussian graphical model. This problem can be formulated as a penalized maximum likelihood estimation of the precision matrix under Laplacian structural constraints. Like in the classical graphical lasso problem, recent works made use of the $\ell_1$-norm with the goal of promoting sparsity in the Laplacian constrained precision matrix estimation. However, through empirical evidence, we observe that the $\ell_1$-norm is not effective in imposing a sparse solution in this problem. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a large regularization parameter will surprisingly lead to a solution representing a fully connected graph instead of a sparse graph. To address this issue, we propose a nonconvex penalized maximum likelihood estimation method, and establish the order of the statistical error. Numerical experiments involving synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    * Abstract: This paper introduces Deep Statistical Solvers (DSS), a new class of trainable solvers for optimization problems, arising e.g., from system simulations. The key idea is to learn a solver that generalizes to a given distribution of problem instances. This is achieved by directly using as loss the objective function of the problem, as opposed to most previous Machine Learning based approaches, which mimic the solutions attained by an existing solver. Though both types of approaches outperform classical solvers with respect to speed for a given accuracy, a distinctive advantage of DSS is that they can be trained without a training set of sample solutions. Focusing on use cases of systems of interacting and interchangeable entities (e.g. molecular dynamics, power systems, discretized PDEs), the proposed approach is instantiated within a class of Graph Neural Networks. Under sufficient conditions, we prove that the corresponding set of functions contains approximations to any arbitrary precision of the actual solution of the optimization problem. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on large linear problems, demonstrating super-generalisation properties; And on AC power grid simulations, on which the predictions of the trained model have a correlation higher than 99.99% with the outputs of the classical Newton-Raphson method (known for its accuracy), while being 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster.

    * Abstract: Weighted model integration (WMI) is a framework to perform advanced probabilistic inference on hybrid domains, i.e., on distributions over mixed continuous-discrete random variables and in presence of complex logical and arithmetic constraints. In this work, we advance the WMI framework on both the theoretical and algorithmic side. First, we exactly trace the boundaries of tractability for WMI inference by proving that to be amenable to exact and efficient inference a WMI problem has to posses a tree-shaped structure with logarithmic diameter. While this result deepens our theoretical understanding of WMI it hinders the practical applicability of exact WMI solvers to real-world problems. To overcome this, we propose the first approximate WMI solver that does not resort to sampling, but performs exact inference on one approximate models. Our solution performs message passing in a relaxed problem structure iteratively to recover certain lost dependencies and, as our experiments suggest, is competitive with other SOTA WMI solvers.

In particular, we generalize the existing result on the existence of deep discontinuous phase in ReLU networks to functional classes of arbitrary positive smoothness, and identify the boundary between the feasible and infeasible rates. Moreover, we show that all networks with a piecewise polynomial activation function have the same phase diagram. Next, we demonstrate that standard fully-connected architectures with a fixed width independent of smoothness can adapt to smoothness and achieve almost optimal rates. Finally, we consider deep networks with periodic activations ("deep Fourier expansion") and prove that they have very fast, nearly exponential approximation rates, thanks to the emerging capability of the network to implement efficient lookup operations.

    * Abstract: Perturbations targeting the graph structure have proven to be extremely effective in reducing the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and traditional defenses such as adversarial training do not seem to be able to improve robustness. This work is motivated by the observation that adversarially injected edges effectively can be viewed as additional samples to a node's neighborhood aggregation function, which results in distorted aggregations accumulating over the layers. Conventional GNN aggregation functions, such as a sum or mean, can be distorted arbitrarily by a single outlier. We propose a robust aggregation function motivated by the field of robust statistics. Our approach exhibits the largest possible breakdown point of 0.5, which means that the bias of the aggregation is bounded as long as the fraction of adversarial edges of a node is less than 50%. Our novel aggregation function, Soft Medoid, is a fully differentiable generalization of the Medoid and therefore lends itself well for end-to-end deep learning. Equipping a GNN with our aggregation improves the robustness with respect to structure perturbations on Cora ML by a factor of 3 (and 5.5 on Citeseer) and by a factor of 8 for low-degree nodes.

    * Abstract: We propose PLLay, a novel topological layer for general deep learning models based on persistence landscapes, in which we can efficiently exploit the underlying topological features of the input data structure. In this work, we show differentiability with respect to layer inputs, for a general persistent homology with arbitrary filtration. Thus, our proposed layer can be placed anywhere in the network and feed critical information on the topological features of input data into subsequent layers to improve the learnability of the networks toward a given task. A task-optimal structure of PLLay is learned during training via backpropagation, without requiring any input featurization or data preprocessing. We provide a novel adaptation for the DTM function-based filtration, and show that the proposed layer is robust against noise and outliers through a stability analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by classification experiments on various datasets.

    * Abstract: We present a novel nonparametric algorithm for symmetry-based disentangling of data manifolds, the Geometric Manifold Component Estimator (GEOMANCER). GEOMANCER provides a partial answer to the question posed by Higgins et al.(2018): is it possible to learn how to factorize a Lie group solely from observations of the orbit of an object it acts on? We show that fully unsupervised factorization of a data manifold is possible if the true metric of the manifold is known and each factor manifold has nontrivial holonomy – for example, rotation in 3D. Our algorithm works by estimating the subspaces that are invariant under random walk diffusion, giving an approximation to the de Rham decomposition from differential geometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of GEOMANCER on several complex synthetic manifolds. Our work reduces the question of whether unsupervised disentangling is possible to the question of whether unsupervised metric learning is possible, providing a unifying insight into the geometric nature of representation learning.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose polynomial forms to represent distributions of state variables over time for discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems. This problem arises in a variety of applications in areas ranging from biology to robotics. Our approach allows us to rigorously represent the probability distribution of state variables over time, and provide guaranteed bounds on the expectations, moments and probabilities of tail events involving the state variables. First, we recall ideas from interval arithmetic, and use them to rigorously represent the state variables at time t as a function of the initial state variables and noise symbols that model the random exogenous inputs encountered before time t. Next, we show how concentration of measure inequalities can be employed to prove rigorous bounds on the tail probabilities of these state variables. We demonstrate interesting applications that demonstrate how our approach can be useful in some situations to establish mathematically guaranteed bounds that are of a different nature from those obtained through simulations with pseudo-random numbers.

    * Abstract: To be well-behaved, systems that process preference data must satisfy certain conditions identified by economic decision theory and by social choice theory. In ML, preferences and rankings are commonly learned by fitting a probabilistic model to noisy preference data. The behavior of this learning process from the view of economic theory has previously been studied for the case where the data consists of rankings. In practice, it is more common to have only pairwise comparison data, and the formal properties of the associated learning problem are more challenging to analyze. We show that a large class of random utility models (including the Thurstone–Mosteller Model), when estimated using the MLE, satisfy a Pareto efficiency condition. These models also satisfy a strong monotonicity property, which implies that the learning process is responsive to input data. On the other hand, we show that these models fail certain other consistency conditions from social choice theory, and in particular do not always follow the majority opinion. Our results inform existing and future applications of random utility models for societal decision making.

Our approach is inspired by persistent homology, dependency parsing for NLP, and multivalued functions.

    * Abstract: Many problems in machine learning (ML) can be cast as learning functions from sets to graphs, or more generally to hypergraphs; in short, Set2Graph functions. Examples include clustering, learning vertex and edge features on graphs, and learning features on triplets in a collection. A natural approach for building Set2Graph models is to characterize all linear equivariant set-to-hypergraph layers and stack them with non-linear activations. This posses two challenges: (i) the expressive power of these networks is not well understood; and (ii) these models would suffer from high, often intractable computational and memory complexity, as their dimension grows exponentially. This paper advocates a family of neural network models for learning Set2Graph functions that is both practical and of maximal expressive power (universal), that is, can approximate arbitrary continuous Set2Graph functions over compact sets. Testing these models on different machine learning tasks, mainly an application to particle physics, we find them favorable to existing baselines.

    * Abstract: We present the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), a diverse set of challenging and realistic benchmark datasets to facilitate scalable, robust, and reproducible graph machine learning (ML) research. OGB datasets are large-scale, encompass multiple important graph ML tasks, and cover a diverse range of domains, ranging from social and information networks to biological networks, molecular graphs, source code ASTs, and knowledge graphs. For each dataset, we provide a unified evaluation protocol using meaningful application-specific data splits and evaluation metrics. In addition to building the datasets, we also perform extensive benchmark experiments for each dataset. Our experiments suggest that OGB datasets present significant challenges of scalability to large-scale graphs and out-of-distribution generalization under realistic data splits, indicating fruitful opportunities for future research. Finally, OGB provides an automated end-to-end graph ML pipeline that simplifies and standardizes the process of graph data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation. OGB will be regularly updated and welcomes inputs from the community. OGB datasets as well as data loaders, evaluation scripts, baseline code, and leaderboards are publicly available at https://ogb.stanford.edu .

    * Abstract: Given a graph or similarity matrix, we consider the problem of recovering a notion of true distance between the nodes, and so their true positions. We show that this can be accomplished in two steps: matrix factorisation, followed by nonlinear dimension reduction. This combination is effective because the point cloud obtained in the first step lives close to a manifold in which latent distance is encoded as geodesic distance. Hence, a nonlinear dimension reduction tool, approximating geodesic distance, can recover the latent positions, up to a simple transformation. We give a detailed account of the case where spectral embedding is used, followed by Isomap, and provide encouraging experimental evidence for other combinations of techniques.

    * Abstract: Nonparametric regression on complex domains has been a challenging task as most existing methods, such as ensemble models based on binary decision trees, are not designed to account for intrinsic geometries and domain boundaries. This article proposes a Bayesian additive regression spanning trees (BAST) model for nonparametric regression on manifolds, with an emphasis on complex constrained domains or irregularly shaped spaces embedded in Euclidean spaces. Our model is built upon a random spanning tree manifold partition model as each weak learner, which is capable of capturing any irregularly shaped spatially contiguous partitions while respecting intrinsic geometries and domain boundary constraints. Utilizing many nice properties of spanning tree structures, we design an efficient Bayesian inference algorithm. Equipped with a soft prediction scheme, BAST is demonstrated to significantly outperform other competing methods in simulation experiments and in an application to the chlorophyll data in Aral Sea, due to its strong local adaptivity to different levels of smoothness.

    * Abstract: We investigate the parameterized complexity of Bayesian Network Structure Learning (BNSL), a classical problem that has received significant attention in empirical but also purely theoretical studies. We follow up on previous works that have analyzed the complexity of BNSL w.r.t. the so-called superstructure of the input. While known results imply that BNSL is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even when parameterized by the size of a vertex cover in the superstructure, here we show that a different kind of parameterization - notably by the size of a feedback edge set - yields fixed-parameter tractability. We proceed by showing that this result can be strengthened to a localized version of the feedback edge set, and provide corresponding lower bounds that complement previous results to provide a complexity classification of BNSL w.r.t. virtually all well-studied graph parameters.We then analyze how the complexity of BNSL depends on the representation of the input. In particular, while the bulk of past theoretical work on the topic assumed the use of the so-called non-zero representation, here we prove that if an additive representation can be used instead then BNSL becomes fixed-parameter tractable even under significantly milder restrictions to the superstructure, notably when parameterized by the treewidth alone. Last but not least, we show how our results can be extended to the closely related problem of Polytree Learning.

    * Authors: Changwoo Lee, Zhao Tang Luo, Huiyan Sang
    * Abstract: Graphs have been commonly used to represent complex data structures. In models dealing with graph-structured data, multivariate parameters may not only exhibit sparse patterns but have structured sparsity and smoothness in the sense that both zero and non-zero parameters tend to cluster together. We propose a new prior for high-dimensional parameters with graphical relations, referred to as the Tree-based Low-rank Horseshoe (T-LoHo) model, that generalizes the popular univariate Bayesian horseshoe shrinkage prior to the multivariate setting to detect structured sparsity and smoothness simultaneously. The T-LoHo prior can be embedded in many high-dimensional hierarchical models. To illustrate its utility, we apply it to regularize a Bayesian high-dimensional regression problem where the regression coefficients are linked by a graph, so that the resulting clusters have flexible shapes and satisfy the cluster contiguity constraint with respect to the graph. We design an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that delivers full Bayesian inference with uncertainty measures for model parameters such as the number of clusters. We offer theoretical investigations of the clustering effects and posterior concentration results. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the model with simulation studies and a real data application for anomaly detection on a road network. The results indicate substantial improvements over other competing methods such as the sparse fused lasso.

    * Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved superior performance in various applications, but training dedicated GNNs can be costly for large-scale graphs. Some recent work started to study the pre-training of GNNs. However, none of them provide theoretical insights into the design of their frameworks, or clear requirements and guarantees towards their transferability. In this work, we establish a theoretically grounded and practically useful framework for the transfer learning of GNNs. Firstly, we propose a novel view towards the essential graph information and advocate the capturing of it as the goal of transferable GNN training, which motivates the design of EGI (Ego-Graph Information maximization) to analytically achieve this goal. Secondly,when node features are structure-relevant, we conduct an analysis of EGI transferability regarding the difference between the local graph Laplacians of the source and target graphs. We conduct controlled synthetic experiments to directly justify our theoretical conclusions. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world network datasets show consistent results in the analyzed setting of direct-transfering, while those on large-scale knowledge graphs show promising results in the more practical setting of transfering with fine-tuning.

    * Abstract: Existing equivariant neural networks require prior knowledge of the symmetry group and discretization for continuous groups. We propose to work with Lie algebras (infinitesimal generators) instead of Lie groups. Our model, the Lie algebra convolutional network (L-conv) can automatically discover symmetries and does not require discretization of the group. We show that L-conv can serve as a building block to construct any group equivariant feedforward architecture. Both CNNs and Graph Convolutional Networks can be expressed as L-conv with appropriate groups. We discover direct connections between L-conv and physics: (1) group invariant loss generalizes field theory (2) Euler-Lagrange equation measures the robustness, and (3) equivariance leads to conservation laws and Noether current. These connections open up new avenues for designing more general equivariant networks and applying them to important problems in physical sciences.

    * Abstract: We contribute to a better understanding of the class of functions that is represented by a neural network with ReLU activations and a given architecture. Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient for learning tasks. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no restrictions on size). This problem has potential impact on algorithmic and statistical aspects because of the insight it provides into the class of functions represented by neural hypothesis classes. However, to the best of our knowledge, this question has not been investigated in the neural network literature. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks required to represent functions in these neural hypothesis classes.

    * Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) has achieved great success in many machine learning tasks by virtue of its high expressive power. However, its prediction can be easily biased to undesirable features, which are not essential for solving the target task and are even imperceptible to a human, thereby resulting in poor generalization. Leveraging plenty of undesirable features in out-of-distribution (OOD) examples has emerged as a potential solution for de-biasing such features, and a recent study shows that softmax-level calibration of OOD examples can successfully remove the contribution of undesirable features to the last fully-connected layer of a classifier. However, its applicability is confined to the classification task, and its impact on a DNN feature extractor is not properly investigated. In this paper, we propose Taufe, a novel regularizer that deactivates many undesirable features using OOD examples in the feature extraction layer and thus removes the dependency on the task-specific softmax layer. To show the task-agnostic nature of Taufe, we rigorously validate its performance on three tasks, classification, regression, and a mix of them, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, CUB200, and CAR datasets. The results demonstrate that Taufe consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method as well as the baselines without regularization.

    * Abstract: We introduce DMTet, a deep 3D conditional generative model that can synthesize high-resolution 3D shapes using simple user guides such as coarse voxels. It marries the merits of implicit and explicit 3D representations by leveraging a novel hybrid 3D representation. Compared to the current implicit approaches, which are trained to regress the signed distance values, DMTet directly optimizes for the reconstructed surface, which enables us to synthesize finer geometric details with fewer artifacts. Unlike deep 3D generative models that directly generate explicit representations such as meshes, our model can synthesize shapes with arbitrary topology. The core of DMTet includes a deformable tetrahedral grid that encodes a discretized signed distance function and a differentiable marching tetrahedra layer that converts the implicit signed distance representation to the explicit surface mesh representation. This combination allows joint optimization of the surface geometry and topology as well as generation of the hierarchy of subdivisions using reconstruction and adversarial losses defined explicitly on the surface mesh. Our approach significantly outperforms existing work on conditional shape synthesis from coarse voxel inputs, trained on a dataset of complex 3D animal shapes.

    * Abstract: We study the problem of inferring time-varying Gaussian Markov random fields, where the underlying graphical model is both sparse and changes {sparsely} over time. Most of the existing methods for the inference of time-varying Markov random fields (MRFs) rely on the \textit{regularized maximum likelihood estimation} (MLE), that typically suffer from weak statistical guarantees and high computational time. Instead, we introduce a new class of constrained optimization problems for the inference of sparsely-changing Gaussian MRFs (GMRFs). The proposed optimization problem is formulated based on the exact $\ell_0$ regularization, and can be solved in near-linear time and memory. Moreover, we show that the proposed estimator enjoys a provably small estimation error. We derive sharp statistical guarantees in the high-dimensional regime, showing that such problems can be learned with as few as one sample per time period. Our proposed method is extremely efficient in practice: it can accurately estimate sparsely-changing GMRFs with more than 500 million variables in less than one hour.

    * Abstract: Disobeying the classical wisdom of statistical learning theory, modern deep neural networks generalize well even though they typically contain millions of parameters. Recently, it has been shown that the trajectories of iterative optimization algorithms can possess \emph{fractal structures}, and their generalization error can be formally linked to the complexity of such fractals. This complexity is measured by the fractal's \emph{intrinsic dimension}, a quantity usually much smaller than the number of parameters in the network. Even though this perspective provides an explanation for why overparametrized networks would not overfit, computing the intrinsic dimension (\eg, for monitoring generalization during training) is a notoriously difficult task, where existing methods typically fail even in moderate ambient dimensions. In this study, we consider this problem from the lens of topological data analysis (TDA) and develop a generic computational tool that is built on rigorous mathematical foundations. By making a novel connection between learning theory and TDA, we first illustrate that the generalization error can be equivalently bounded in terms of a notion called the 'persistent homology dimension' (PHD), where, compared with prior work, our approach does not require any additional geometrical or statistical assumptions on the training dynamics. Then, by utilizing recently established theoretical results and TDA tools, we develop an efficient algorithm to estimate PHD in the scale of modern deep neural networks and further provide visualization tools to help understand generalization in deep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can efficiently compute a network's intrinsic dimension in a variety of settings, which is predictive of the generalization error.

    * Abstract: The cooperative bandit problem is increasingly becoming relevant due to its applications in large-scale decision-making. However, most research for this problem focuses exclusively on the setting with perfect communication, whereas in most real-world distributed settings, communication is often over stochastic networks, with arbitrary corruptions and delays. In this paper, we study cooperative bandit learning under three typical real-world communication scenarios, namely, (a) message-passing over stochastic time-varying networks, (b) instantaneous reward-sharing over a network with random delays, and (c) message-passing with adversarially corrupted rewards, including byzantine communication. For each of these environments, we propose decentralized algorithms that achieve competitive performance, along with near-optimal guarantees on the incurred group regret as well. Furthermore, in the setting with perfect communication, we present an improved delayed-update algorithm that outperforms the existing state-of-the-art on various network topologies. Finally, we present tight network-dependent minimax lower bounds on the group regret. Our proposed algorithms are straightforward to implement and obtain competitive empirical performance.

Our simple construction bypasses complicated recursive routines of finding sparse cuts known in the literature. Our second and main result is an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for a wide family of graphs that exhibit a well-defined structure of clusters. This result generalises the previous state-of-the-art, which holds only for graphs generated from stochastic models. The significance of our work is demonstrated by the empirical analysis on both synthetic and real-world data sets, on which our presented algorithm outperforms the previously proposed algorithm for graphs with a well-defined cluster structure.

    * Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown the power in graph representation learning for numerous tasks. In this work, we discover an interesting phenomenon that although residual connections in the message passing of GNNs help improve the performance, they immensely amplify GNNs' vulnerability against abnormal node features. This is undesirable because in real-world applications, node features in graphs could often be abnormal such as being naturally noisy or adversarially manipulated. We analyze possible reasons to understand this phenomenon and aim to design GNNs with stronger resilience to abnormal features. Our understandings motivate us to propose and derive a simple, efficient, interpretable, and adaptive message passing scheme, leading to a novel GNN with Adaptive Residual, AirGNN. Extensive experiments under various abnormal feature scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

    * Abstract: Prediction of a molecule’s 3D conformer ensemble from the molecular graph holds a key role in areas of cheminformatics and drug discovery. Existing generative models have several drawbacks including lack of modeling important molecular geometry elements (e.g., torsion angles), separate optimization stages prone to error accumulation, and the need for structure fine-tuning based on approximate classical force-fields or computationally expensive methods. We propose GEOMOL --- an end-to-end, non-autoregressive, and SE(3)-invariant machine learning approach to generate distributions of low-energy molecular 3D conformers. Leveraging the power of message passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture local and global graph information, we predict local atomic 3D structures and torsion angles, avoid- ing unnecessary over-parameterization of the geometric degrees of freedom (e.g., one angle per non-terminal bond). Such local predictions suffice both for both the training loss computation and for the full deterministic conformer assembly (at test time). We devise a non-adversarial optimal transport based loss function to promote diverse conformer generation. GEOMOL predominantly outperforms popular open-source, commercial, or state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, while achieving significant speed-ups. We expect such differentiable 3D structure generators to significantly impact molecular modeling and related applications.

    * Abstract: Geometric alignment appears in a variety of applications, ranging from domain adaptation, optimal transport, and normalizing flows in machine learning; optical flow and learned augmentation in computer vision and deformable registration within biomedical imaging. A recurring challenge is the alignment of domains whose topology is not the same; a problem that is routinely ignored, potentially introducing bias in downstream analysis. As a first step towards solving such alignment problems, we propose an unsupervised algorithm for the detection of changes in image topology. The model is based on a conditional variational auto-encoder and detects topological changes between two images during the registration step. We account for both topological changes in the image under spatial variation and unexpected transformations. Our approach is validated on two tasks and datasets: detection of topological changes in microscopy images of cells, and unsupervised anomaly detection brain imaging.

    * Abstract: We propose a fully differentiable architecture for simultaneous semantic and instance segmentation (a.k.a. panoptic segmentation) consisting of a convolutional neural network and an asymmetric multiway cut problem solver. The latter solves a combinatorial optimization problem that elegantly incorporates semantic and boundary predictions to produce a panoptic labeling. Our formulation allows to directly maximize a smooth surrogate of the panoptic quality metric by backpropagating the gradient through the optimization problem. Experimental evaluation shows improvement by backpropagating through the optimization problem w.r.t. comparable approaches on Cityscapes and COCO datasets. Overall, our approach of combinatorial optimization for panoptic segmentation (COPS) shows the utility of using optimization in tandem with deep learning in a challenging large scale real-world problem and showcases benefits and insights into training such an architecture.

    * Abstract: The null space of the $k$-th order Laplacian $\mathbf{\mathcal L}_k$, known as the {\em $k$-th homology vector space}, encodes the non-trivial topology of a manifold or a network. Understanding the structure of the homology embedding can thus disclose geometric or topological information from the data. The study of the null space embedding of the graph Laplacian $\mathbf{\mathcal L}_0$ has spurred new research and applications, such as spectral clustering algorithms with theoretical guarantees and estimators of the Stochastic Block Model. In this work, we investigate the geometry of the $k$-th homology embedding and focus on cases reminiscent of spectral clustering. Namely, we analyze the {\em connected sum} of manifolds as a perturbation to the direct sum of their homology embeddings. We propose an algorithm to factorize the homology embedding into subspaces corresponding to a manifold's simplest topological components. The proposed framework is applied to the {\em shortest homologous loop detection} problem, a problem known to be NP-hard in general. Our spectral loop detection algorithm scales better than existing methods and is effective on diverse data such as point clouds and images.

    * Abstract: Existing approaches to unsupervised object discovery (UOD) do not scale up to large datasets without approximations that compromise their performance. We propose a novel formulation of UOD as a ranking problem, amenable to the arsenal of distributed methods available for eigenvalue problems and link analysis. Through the use of self-supervised features, we also demonstrate the first effective fully unsupervised pipeline for UOD. Extensive experiments on COCO~\cite{Lin2014cocodataset} and OpenImages~\cite{openimages} show that, in the single-object discovery setting where a single prominent object is sought in each image, the proposed LOD (Large-scale Object Discovery) approach is on par with, or better than the state of the art for medium-scale datasets (up to 120K images), and over 37\% better than the only other algorithms capable of scaling up to 1.7M images. In the multi-object discovery setting where multiple objects are sought in each image, the proposed LOD is over 14\% better in average precision (AP) than all other methods for datasets ranging from 20K to 1.7M images. Using self-supervised features, we also show that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art UOD performance on OpenImages.

    * Abstract: Discovering ideal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) architectures for different tasks is labor intensive and time consuming. To save human efforts, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) recently has been used to automatically discover adequate GNN architectures for certain tasks in order to achieve competitive or even better performance compared with manually designed architectures. However, existing works utilizing NAS to search GNN structures fail to answer the question: how NAS is able to select the desired GNN architectures? In this paper, we investigate this question to solve the problem, for the first time. We conduct a measurement study with experiments to discover that gradient based NAS methods tend to select proper architectures based on the usefulness of different types of information with respect to the target task. Our explorations further show that gradient based NAS also suffers from noises hidden in the graph, resulting in searching suboptimal GNN architectures. Based on our findings, we propose a Graph differentiable Architecture Search model with Structure Optimization (GASSO), which allows differentiable search of the architecture with gradient descent and is able to discover graph neural architectures with better performance through employing graph structure learning as a denoising process in the search procedure. The proposed GASSO model is capable of simultaneously searching the optimal architecture and adaptively adjusting graph structure by jointly optimizing graph architecture search and graph structure denoising. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our proposed GASSO model is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.

We utilize maximum state space size as a more fine-grained measure for the BN's reasoning complexity than the standard treewidth measure, thereby accommodating the possibility that variables range over domains of different sizes. Our methods combine heuristic BN structure learning algorithms with the recently introduced MaxSAT-powered local improvement method (Peruvemba Ramaswamy and Szeider, AAAI'21). Our experiments show that our new learning methods produce BNs that support significantly faster exact probabilistic inference than BNs learned with treewidth bounds.

    * Abstract: The interdependence between nodes in graphs is key to improve class prediction on nodes, utilized in approaches like Label Probagation (LP) or in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Nonetheless, uncertainty estimation for non-independent node-level predictions is under-explored. In this work, we explore uncertainty quantification for node classification in three ways: (1) We derive three axioms explicitly characterizing the expected predictive uncertainty behavior in homophilic attributed graphs.(2) We propose a new model Graph Posterior Network (GPN) which explicitly performs Bayesian posterior updates for predictions on interdependent nodes. GPN provably obeys the proposed axioms. (3) We extensively evaluate GPN and a strong set of baselines on semi-supervised node classification including detection of anomalous features, and detection of left-out classes. GPN outperforms existing approaches for uncertainty estimation in the experiments.

    * Abstract: State-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have limited scalability with respect to the graph and model sizes. On large graphs, increasing the model depth often means exponential expansion of the scope (i.e., receptive field). Beyond just a few layers, two fundamental challenges emerge: 1. degraded expressivity due to oversmoothing, and 2. expensive computation due to neighborhood explosion. We propose a design principle to decouple the depth and scope of GNNs – to generate representation of a target entity (i.e., a node or an edge), we first extract a localized subgraph as the bounded-size scope, and then apply a GNN of arbitrary depth on top of the subgraph. A properly extracted subgraph consists of a small number of critical neighbors, while excluding irrelevant ones. The GNN, no matter how deep it is, smooths the local neighborhood into informative representation rather than oversmoothing the global graph into “white noise”. Theoretically, decoupling improves the GNN expressive power from the perspectives of graph signal processing (GCN), function approximation (GraphSAGE) and topological learning (GIN). Empirically, on seven graphs (with up to 110M nodes) and six backbone GNN architectures, our design achieves significant accuracy improvement with orders of magnitude reduction in computation and hardware cost.

    * Abstract: Predicting stable 3D conformations from 2D molecular graphs has been a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry. Recently, machine learning approaches have demonstrated very promising results compared to traditional experimental and physics-based simulation methods. These approaches mainly focus on modeling the local interactions between neighboring atoms on the molecular graphs and overlook the long-range interactions between non-bonded atoms. However, these non-bonded atoms may be proximal to each other in 3D space, and modeling their interactions is of crucial importance to accurately determine molecular conformations, especially for large molecules and multi-molecular complexes. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Dynamic Graph Score Matching (DGSM) for molecular conformation prediction, which models both the local and long-range interactions by dynamically constructing graph structures between atoms according to their spatial proximity during both training and inference. Specifically, the DGSM directly estimates the gradient fields of the logarithm density of atomic coordinates according to the dynamically constructed graphs using score matching methods. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments across multiple tasks show that the DGSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and it is capable of generating conformations for a broader range of systems such as proteins and multi-molecular complexes.

    * Abstract: Variational methods are extremely popular in the analysis of network data. Statistical guarantees obtained for these methods typically provide asymptotic normality for the problem of estimation of global model parameters under the stochastic block model. In the present work, we consider the case of networks with missing links that is important in application and show that the variational approximation to the maximum likelihood estimator converges at the minimax rate. This provides the first minimax optimal and tractable estimator for the problem of parameter estimation for the stochastic block model with missing links. We complement our results with numerical studies of simulated and real networks, which confirm the advantages of this estimator over current methods.

    * Abstract: Riemannian space forms, such as the Euclidean space, sphere and hyperbolic space, are popular and powerful representation spaces in machine learning. For instance, hyperbolic geometry is appropriate to represent graphs without cycles and has been used to extend Graph Neural Networks. Recently, some pseudo-Riemannian space forms that generalize both hyperbolic and spherical geometries have been exploited to learn a specific type of nonparametric embedding called ultrahyperbolic. The lack of geodesic between every pair of ultrahyperbolic points makes the task of learning parametric models (e.g., neural networks) difficult. This paper introduces a method to learn parametric models in ultrahyperbolic space. We experimentally show the relevance of our approach in the tasks of graph and node classification.

    * Abstract: The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) largely relies on the process of aggregating information from neighbors defined by the input graph structures. Notably, message passing based GNNs, e.g., graph convolutional networks, leverage the immediate neighbors of each node during the aggregation process, and recently, graph diffusion convolution (GDC) is proposed to expand the propagation neighborhood by leveraging generalized graph diffusion. However, the neighborhood size in GDC is manually tuned for each graph by conducting grid search over the validation set, making its generalization practically limited. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive diffusion convolution (ADC) strategy to automatically learn the optimal neighborhood size from the data. Furthermore, we break the conventional assumption that all GNN layers and feature channels (dimensions) should use the same neighborhood for propagation. We design strategies to enable ADC to learn a dedicated propagation neighborhood for each GNN layer and each feature channel, making the GNN architecture fully coupled with graph structures---the unique property that differs GNNs from traditional neural networks. By directly plugging ADC into existing GNNs, we observe consistent and significant outperformance over both GDC and their vanilla versions across various datasets, demonstrating the improved model capacity brought by automatically learning unique neighborhood size per layer and per channel in GNNs.

    * Abstract: In imperfect-information games, subgame solving is significantly more challenging than in perfect-information games, but in the last few years, such techniques have been developed. They were the key ingredient to the milestone of superhuman play in no-limit Texas hold'em poker. Current subgame-solving techniques analyze the entire common-knowledge closure of the player's current information set, that is, the smallest set of nodes within which it is common knowledge that the current node lies. While this is acceptable in games like poker where the common-knowledge closure is relatively small, many practical games have more complex information structure, which renders the common-knowledge closure impractically large to enumerate or even reasonably approximate. We introduce an approach that overcomes this obstacle, by instead working with only low-order knowledge. Our approach allows an agent, upon arriving at an infoset, to basically prune any node that is no longer reachable, thereby massively reducing the game tree size relative to the common-knowledge subgame. We prove that, as is, our approach can increase exploitability compared to the blueprint strategy. However, we develop three avenues by which safety can be guaranteed. First, safety is guaranteed if the results of subgame solves are incorporated back into the blueprint. Second, we provide a method where safety is achieved by limiting the infosets at which subgame solving is performed. Third, we prove that our approach, when applied at every infoset reached during play, achieves a weaker notion of equilibrium, which we coin affine equilibrium, and which may be of independent interest. We show that affine equilibria cannot be exploited by any Nash strategy of the opponent, so an opponent who wishes to exploit must open herself to counter-exploitation. Even without the safety-guaranteeing additions, experiments on medium-sized games show that our approach always reduced exploitability in practical games even when applied at every infoset, and a depth-limited version of it led to---to our knowledge---the first strong AI for the challenge problem dark chess.

    * Abstract: Why do many modern neural-network-based graph generative models fail to reproduce typical real-world network characteristics, such as high triangle density? In this work we study the limitations of $edge\ independent\ random\ graph\ models$, in which each edge is added to the graph independently with some probability. Such models include both the classic Erdos-Renyi and stochastic block models, as well as modern generative models such as NetGAN, variational graph autoencoders, and CELL. We prove that subject to a $bounded\ overlap$ condition, which ensures that the model does not simply memorize a single graph, edge independent models are inherently limited in their ability to generate graphs with high triangle and other subgraph densities. Notably, such high densities are known to appear in real-world social networks and other graphs. We complement our negative results with a simple generative model that balances overlap and accuracy, performing comparably to more complex models in reconstructing many graph statistics.

    * Abstract: In causal bandit problems the action set consists of interventions on variables of a causal graph. Several researchers have recently studied such bandit problems and pointed out their practical applications. However, all existing works rely on a restrictive and impractical assumption that the learner is given full knowledge of the causal graph structure upfront. In this paper, we develop novel causal bandit algorithms without knowing the causal graph. Our algorithms work well for causal trees, causal forests and a general class of causal graphs. The regret guarantees of our algorithms greatly improve upon those of standard multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms under mild conditions. Lastly, we prove our mild conditions are necessary: without them one cannot do better than standard MAB algorithms.

    * Abstract: Proteins are fundamental biological entities mediating key roles in cellular function and disease. This paper introduces a multi-scale graph construction of a protein –HoloProt– connecting surface to structure and sequence. The surface captures coarser details of the protein, while sequence as primary component and structure –comprising secondary and tertiary components– capture finer details. Our graph encoder then learns a multi-scale representation by allowing each level to integrate the encoding from level(s) below with the graph at that level. We test the learned representation on different tasks, (i.) ligand binding affinity (regression), and (ii.) protein function prediction (classification).On the regression task, contrary to previous methods, our model performs consistently and reliably across different dataset splits, outperforming all baselines on most splits. On the classification task, it achieves a performance close to the top-performing model while using 10x fewer parameters. To improve the memory efficiency of our construction, we segment the multiplex protein surface manifold into molecular superpixels and substitute the surface with these superpixels at little to no performance loss.

    * Abstract: In recent years, several results in the supervised learning setting suggested that classical statistical learning-theoretic measures, such as VC dimension, do not adequately explain the performance of deep learning models which prompted a slew of work in the infinite-width and iteration regimes. However, there is little theoretical explanation for the success of neural networks beyond the supervised setting. In this paper we argue that, under some distributional assumptions, classical learning-theoretic measures can sufficiently explain generalization for graph neural networks in the transductive setting. In particular, we provide a rigorous analysis of the performance of neural networks in the context of transductive inference, specifically by analysing the generalisation properties of graph convolutional networks for the problem of node classification. While VC-dimension does result in trivial generalisation error bounds in this setting as well, we show that transductive Rademacher complexity can explain the generalisation properties of graph convolutional networks for stochastic block models. We further use the generalisation error bounds based on transductive Rademacher complexity to demonstrate the role of graph convolutions and network architectures in achieving smaller generalisation error and provide insights into when the graph structure can help in learning. The findings of this paper could re-new the interest in studying generalisation in neural networks in terms of learning-theoretic measures, albeit in specific problems.

    * Abstract: Data with low-dimensional nonlinear structure are ubiquitous in engineering and scientific problems. We study a model problem with such structure---a binary classification task that uses a deep fully-connected neural network to classify data drawn from two disjoint smooth curves on the unit sphere. Aside from mild regularity conditions, we place no restrictions on the configuration of the curves. We prove that when (i) the network depth is large relative to certain geometric properties that set the difficulty of the problem and (ii) the network width and number of samples is polynomial in the depth, randomly-initialized gradient descent quickly learns to correctly classify all points on the two curves with high probability. To our knowledge, this is the first generalization guarantee for deep networks with nonlinear data that depends only on intrinsic data properties. Our analysis proceeds by a reduction to dynamics in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, where the network depth plays the role of a fitting resource in solving the classification problem. In particular, via fine-grained control of the decay properties of the NTK, we demonstrate that when the network is sufficiently deep, the NTK can be locally approximated by a translationally invariant operator on the manifolds and stably inverted over smooth functions, which guarantees convergence and generalization.

    * Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CorticalFlow, a new geometric deep-learning model that, given a 3-dimensional image, learns to deform a reference template towards a targeted object. To conserve the template mesh’s topological properties, we train our model over a set of diffeomorphic transformations. This new implementation of a flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework benefits from a small GPU memory footprint, allowing the generation of surfaces with several hundred thousand vertices. To reduce topological errors introduced by its discrete resolution, we derive numeric conditions which improve the manifoldness of the predicted triangle mesh. To exhibit the utility of CorticalFlow, we demonstrate its performance for the challenging task of brain cortical surface reconstruction. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, CorticalFlow produces superior surfaces while reducing the computation time from nine and a half minutes to one second. More significantly, CorticalFlow enforces the generation of anatomically plausible surfaces; the absence of which has been a major impediment restricting the clinical relevance of such surface reconstruction methods.

    * Abstract: Normalizing flows are invertible neural networks with tractable change-of-volume terms, which allow optimization of their parameters to be efficiently performed via maximum likelihood. However, data of interest are typically assumed to live in some (often unknown) low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. The result is a modelling mismatch since -- by construction -- the invertibility requirement implies high-dimensional support of the learned distribution. Injective flows, mappings from low- to high-dimensional spaces, aim to fix this discrepancy by learning distributions on manifolds, but the resulting volume-change term becomes more challenging to evaluate. Current approaches either avoid computing this term entirely using various heuristics, or assume the manifold is known beforehand and therefore are not widely applicable. Instead, we propose two methods to tractably calculate the gradient of this term with respect to the parameters of the model, relying on careful use of automatic differentiation and techniques from numerical linear algebra. Both approaches perform end-to-end nonlinear manifold learning and density estimation for data projected onto this manifold. We study the trade-offs between our proposed methods, empirically verify that we outperform approaches ignoring the volume-change term by more accurately learning manifolds and the corresponding distributions on them, and show promising results on out-of-distribution detection.

    * Abstract: Branched optimal transport (BOT) is a generalization of optimal transport in which transportation costs along an edge are subadditive. This subadditivity models an increase in transport efficiency when shipping mass along the same route, favoring branched transportation networks. We here study the NP-hard optimization of BOT networks connecting a finite number of sources and sinks in $\mathbb{R}^2$. First, we show how to efficiently find the best geometry of a BOT network for many sources and sinks, given a topology. Second, we argue that a topology with more than three edges meeting at a branching point is never optimal. Third, we show that the results obtained for the Euclidean plane generalize directly to optimal transportation networks on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Finally, we present a simple but effective approximate BOT solver combining geometric optimization with a combinatorial optimization of the network topology.

    * Abstract: In this study, we present \textit{meta-sequential prediction} (MSP), an unsupervised framework to learn the symmetry from the time sequence of length at least three. Our method leverages the stationary property~(e.g. constant velocity, constant acceleration) of the time sequence to learn the underlying equivariant structure of the dataset by simply training the encoder-decoder model to be able to predict the future observations. We will demonstrate that, with our framework, the hidden disentangled structure of the dataset naturally emerges as a by-product by applying \textit{simultaneous block-diagonalization} to the transition operators in the latent space, the procedure which is commonly used in representation theory to decompose the feature-space based on the type of response to group actions.We will showcase our method from both empirical and theoretical perspectives.Our result suggests that finding a simple structured relation and learning a model with extrapolation capability are two sides of the same coin.

    * Abstract: Molecule generation is central to a variety of applications. Current attention has been paid to approaching the generation task as subgraph prediction and assembling. Nevertheless, these methods usually rely on hand-crafted or external subgraph construction, and the subgraph assembling depends solely on local arrangement. In this paper, we define a novel notion, principal subgraph that is closely related to the informative pattern within molecules. Interestingly, our proposed merge-and-update subgraph extraction method can automatically discover frequent principal subgraphs from the dataset, while previous methods are incapable of. Moreover, we develop a two-step subgraph assembling strategy, which first predicts a set of subgraphs in a sequence-wise manner and then assembles all generated subgraphs globally as the final output molecule. Built upon graph variational auto-encoder, our model is demonstrated to be effective in terms of several evaluation metrics and efficiency, compared with state-of-the-art methods on distribution learning and (constrained) property optimization tasks.

    * Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received extensive research attention for their promising performance in graph machine learning. Despite their extraordinary predictive accuracy, existing approaches, such as GCN and GPRGNN, are not robust in the face of homophily changes on test graphs, rendering these models vulnerable to graph structural attacks and with limited capacity in generalizing to graphs of varied homophily levels. Although many methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of GNN models, most of these techniques are restricted to the spatial domain and employ complicated defense mechanisms, such as learning new graph structures or calculating edge attentions. In this paper, we study the problem of designing simple and robust GNN models in the spectral domain. We propose EvenNet, a spectral GNN corresponding to an even-polynomial graph filter. Based on our theoretical analysis in both spatial and spectral domains, we demonstrate that EvenNet outperforms full-order models in generalizing across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, implying that ignoring odd-hop neighbors improves the robustness of GNNs. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of EvenNet. Notably, EvenNet outperforms existing defense models against structural attacks without introducing additional computational costs and maintains competitiveness in traditional node classification tasks on homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

    * Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been applied to graph learning tasks and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. However, many competitive methods run GNNs multiple times with subgraph extraction and customized labeling to capture information that is hard for normal GNNs to learn. Such operations are time-consuming and do not scale to large graphs. In this paper, we propose an efficient GNN framework called Geodesic GNN (GDGNN) that requires only one GNN run and injects conditional relationships between nodes into the model without labeling. This strategy effectively reduces the runtime of subgraph methods. Specifically, we view the shortest paths between two nodes as the spatial graph context of the neighborhood around them. The GNN embeddings of nodes on the shortest paths are used to generate geodesic representations. Conditioned on the geodesic representations, GDGNN can generate node, link, and graph representations that carry much richer structural information than plain GNNs. We theoretically prove that GDGNN is more powerful than plain GNNs. We present experimental results to show that GDGNN achieves highly competitive performance with SOTA GNN models on various graph learning tasks while taking significantly less time.

    * Authors: Qian Huang, Hongyu Ren, Jure Leskovec
    * Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph (KG) completion task aims to perform inductive reasoning over the KG: given only a few support triplets of a new relation $\bowtie$ (e.g., (chop,$\bowtie$,kitchen), (read,$\bowtie$,library), the goal is to predict the query triplets of the same unseen relation $\bowtie$, e.g., (sleep,$\bowtie$,?). Current approaches cast the problem in a meta-learning framework, where the model needs to be first jointly trained over many training few-shot tasks, each being defined by its own relation, so that learning/prediction on the target few-shot task can be effective. However, in real-world KGs, curating many training tasks is a challenging ad hoc process. Here we propose Connection Subgraph Reasoner (CSR), which can make predictions for the target few-shot task directly without the need for pre-training on the human curated set of training tasks. The key to CSR is that we explicitly model a shared connection subgraph between support and query triplets, as inspired by the principle of eliminative induction. To adapt to specific KG, we design a corresponding self-supervised pretraining scheme with the objective of reconstructing automatically sampled connection subgraphs. Our pretrained model can then be directly applied to target few-shot tasks on without the need for training few-shot tasks. Extensive experiments on real KGs, including NELL, FB15K-237, and ConceptNet, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework: we show that even a learning-free implementation of CSR can already perform competitively to existing methods on target few-shot tasks; with pretraining, CSR can achieve significant gains of up to 52% on the more challenging inductive few-shot tasks where the entities are also unseen during (pre)training.

    * Authors: Kuan-Lin Chen, Harinath Garudadri, Bhaskar D Rao
    * Abstract: A deep neural network using rectified linear units represents a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function and vice versa. Recent results in the literature estimated that the number of neurons needed to exactly represent any CPWL function grows exponentially with the number of pieces or exponentially in terms of the factorial of the number of distinct linear components. Moreover, such growth is amplified linearly with the input dimension. These existing results seem to indicate that the cost of representing a CPWL function is expensive. In this paper, we propose much tighter bounds and establish a polynomial time algorithm to find a network satisfying these bounds for any given CPWL function. We prove that the number of hidden neurons required to exactly represent any CPWL function is at most a quadratic function of the number of pieces. In contrast to all previous results, this upper bound is invariant to the input dimension. Besides the number of pieces, we also study the number of distinct linear components in CPWL functions. When such a number is also given, we prove that the quadratic complexity turns into bilinear, which implies a lower neural complexity because the number of distinct linear components is always not greater than the minimum number of pieces in a CPWL function. When the number of pieces is unknown, we prove that, in terms of the number of distinct linear components, the neural complexities of any CPWL function are at most polynomial growth for low-dimensional inputs and factorial growth for the worst-case scenario, which are significantly better than existing results in the literature.

    * Abstract: Promoting behavioural diversity is of critical importance in multi-agent reinforcement learning, since it helps the agent population maintain robust performance when encountering unfamiliar opponents at test time, or, when the game is highly non-transitive in the strategy space (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissor). While a myriad of diversity metrics have been proposed, there are no widely accepted or unified definitions in the literature, making the consequent diversity-aware learning algorithms difficult to evaluate and the insights elusive. In this work, we propose a novel metric called the Unified Diversity Measure (UDM) that offers a unified view for existing diversity metrics. Based on UDM, we design the UDM-Fictitious Play (UDM-FP) and UDM-Policy Space Response Oracle (UDM-PSRO) algorithms as efficient solvers for normal-form games and open-ended games. In theory, we prove that UDM-based methods can enlarge the gamescape by increasing the response capacity of the strategy pool, and have convergence guarantee to two-player Nash equilibrium. We validate our algorithms on games that show strong non-transitivity, and empirical results show that our algorithms achieve better performances than strong PSRO baselines in terms of the exploitability and population effectivity.

    * Abstract: Despite the empirical successes of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, it is unclear what characteristics of their representations lead to high downstream accuracies. In this work, we characterize properties that SSL representations should ideally satisfy. Specifically, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions such that for any task invariant to given data augmentations, probes (e.g., linear or MLP) trained on that representation attain perfect accuracy. These requirements lead to a unifying conceptual framework for improving existing SSL methods and deriving new ones. For contrastive learning, our framework prescribes simple but significant improvements to previous methods such as using asymmetric projection heads. For non-contrastive learning, we use our framework to derive a simple and novel objective. Our resulting SSL algorithms outperform baselines on standard benchmarks, including SwAV+multicrops on linear probing of ImageNet.

    * Abstract: Symmetry has been a fundamental tool in the exploration of a broad range of complex systems. In machine learning, symmetry has been explored in both models and data. In this paper we seek to connect the symmetries arising from the architecture of a family of models with the symmetries of that family’s internal representation of data. We do this by calculating a set of fundamental symmetry groups, which we call the intertwiner groups of the model. Each of these arises from a particular nonlinear layer of the model and different nonlinearities result in different symmetry groups. These groups change the weights of a model in such a way that the underlying function that the model represents remains constant but the internal representations of data inside the model may change. We connect intertwiner groups to a model’s internal representations of data through a range of experiments that probe similarities between hidden states across models with the same architecture. Our work suggests that the symmetries of a network are propagated into the symmetries in that network’s representation of data, providing us with a better understanding of how architecture affects the learning and prediction process. Finally, we speculate that for ReLU networks, the intertwiner groups may provide a justification for the common practice of concentrating model interpretability exploration on the activation basis in hidden layers rather than arbitrary linear combinations thereof.

    * Abstract: A critical challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) is for multiple agents to efficiently accomplish complex, long-horizon tasks. The agents often have difficulties in cooperating on common goals, dividing complex tasks, and planning through several stages to make progress. We propose to address these challenges by guiding agents with programs designed for parallelization, since programs as a representation contain rich structural and semantic information, and are widely used as abstractions for long-horizon tasks. Specifically, we introduce Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Parallel Program Guidance(E-MAPP), a novel framework that leverages parallel programs to guide multiple agents to efficiently accomplish goals that require planning over $10+$ stages. E-MAPP integrates the structural information from a parallel program, promotes the cooperative behaviors grounded in program semantics, and improves the time efficiency via a task allocator. We conduct extensive experiments on a series of challenging, long-horizon cooperative tasks in the Overcooked environment. Results show that E-MAPP outperforms strong baselines in terms of the completion rate, time efficiency, and zero-shot generalization ability by a large margin.

VISOR annotates videos from EPIC-KITCHENS, which comes with a new set of challenges not encountered in current video segmentation datasets. Specifically, we need to ensure both short- and long-term consistency of pixel-level annotations as objects undergo transformative interactions, e.g. an onion is peeled, diced and cooked - where we aim to obtain accurate pixel-level annotations of the peel, onion pieces, chopping board, knife, pan, as well as the acting hands. VISOR introduces an annotation pipeline, AI-powered in parts, for scalability and quality. In total, we publicly release 272K manual semantic masks of 257 object classes, 9.9M interpolated dense masks, 67K hand-object relations, covering 36 hours of 179 untrimmed videos. Along with the annotations, we introduce three challenges in video object segmentation, interaction understanding and long-term reasoning.For data, code and leaderboards: http://epic-kitchens.github.io/VISOR

    * Abstract: Modern statistical estimation is often performed in a distributed setting where each sample belongs to single user who shares their data with a central server. Users are typically concerned with preserving the privacy of their sample, and also with minimizing the amount of data they must transmit to the server. We give improved private and communication-efficient algorithms for estimating several popular measures of the entropy of a distribution. All of our algorithms have constant communication cost and satisfy local differential privacy. For a joint distribution on many variables whose conditional independence graph is a tree, we describe algorithms for estimating Shannon entropy that require a number of samples that is linear in the number of variables, compared to the quadratic sample complexity of prior work. We also describe an algorithm for estimating Gini entropy whose sample complexity has no dependence on the support size of the distribution and can be implemented using a single round of concurrent communication between the users and the server, while the previously best-known algorithm has high communication cost and requires the server to facilitate interaction between the users. Finally, we describe an algorithm for estimating collision entropy that matches the space and sample complexity of the best known algorithm but generalizes it to the private and communication-efficient setting.

    * Abstract: Decentralized optimization is increasingly popular in machine learning for its scalability and efficiency. Intuitively, it should also provide better privacy guarantees, as nodes only observe the messages sent by their neighbors in the network graph. But formalizing and quantifying this gain is challenging: existing results are typically limited to Local Differential Privacy (LDP) guarantees that overlook the advantages of decentralization. In this work, we introduce pairwise network differential privacy, a relaxation of LDP that captures the fact that the privacy leakage from a node u to a node v may depend on their relative position in the graph. We then analyze the combination of local noise injection with (simple or randomized) gossip averaging protocols on fixed and random communication graphs. We also derive a differentially private decentralized optimization algorithm that alternates between local gradient descent steps and gossip averaging. Our results show that our algorithms amplify privacy guarantees as a function of the distance between nodes in the graph, matching the privacy-utility trade-off of the trusted curator, up to factors that explicitly depend on the graph topology. Remarkably, these factors become constant for expander graphs. Finally, we illustrate our privacy gains with experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

    * Abstract: We show that, for any sufficiently small fixed $\epsilon > 0$, when both players in a general-sum two-player (bimatrix) game employ optimistic mirror descent (OMD) with smooth regularization, learning rate $\eta = O(\epsilon^2)$ and $T = \Omega(poly(1/\epsilon))$ repetitions, either the dynamics reach an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium (NE), or the average correlated distribution of play is an $\Omega(poly(\epsilon))$-strong coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE): any possible unilateral deviation does not only leave the player worse, but will decrease its utility by $\Omega(poly(\epsilon))$. As an immediate consequence, when the iterates of OMD are bounded away from being Nash equilibria in a bimatrix game, we guarantee convergence to an \emph{exact} CCE after only $O(1)$ iterations. Our results reveal that uncoupled no-regret learning algorithms can converge to CCE in general-sum games remarkably faster than to NE in, for example, zero-sum games. To establish this, we show that when OMD does not reach arbitrarily close to a NE, the (cumulative) regret of both players is not only negative, but decays linearly with time. Given that regret is the canonical measure of performance in online learning, our results suggest that cycling behavior of no-regret learning algorithms in games can be justified in terms of efficiency.

    * Abstract: A long-term goal of reinforcement learning is to design agents that can autonomously interact and learn in the world. A critical challenge to such autonomy is the presence of irreversible states which require external assistance to recover from, such as when a robot arm has pushed an object off of a table. While standard agents require constant monitoring to decide when to intervene, we aim to design proactive agents that can request human intervention only when needed. To this end, we propose an algorithm that efficiently learns to detect and avoid states that are irreversible, and proactively asks for help in case the agent does enter them. On a suite of continuous control environments with unknown irreversible states, we find that our algorithm exhibits better sample- and intervention-efficiency compared to existing methods.

    * Abstract: Given an $n \times n$ non-negative rank-$K$ matrix $\Omega$ where $m$ eigenvalues are negative, when can we write $\Omega = Z P Z'$ for non-negative matrices $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{n, K}$ and $P \in \mathbb{R}^{K, K}$? While most existing works focused on the case of $m = 0$, our primary interest is on the case of general $m$. With new proof ideas we develop, we present sharp results on when the NMF problem is solvable, which significantly extend existing results on this topic. The NMF problem is partially motivated by applications in network modeling. For a network with $K$ communities, rank-$K$ models are popular, with many proposals. The DCMM model is a recent rank-$K$ model which is especially useful and interpretable in practice. To enjoy such properties, it is of interest to study when a rank-$K$ model can be rewritten as a DCMM model. Using our NMF results, we show that for a rank-$K$ model with parameters in the most interesting range, we can always rewrite it as a DCMM model.

    * Abstract: Random walk kernels have been introduced in seminal work on graph learning and were later largely superseded by kernels based on the Weisfeiler-Leman test for graph isomorphism. We give a unified view on both classes of graph kernels. We study walk-based node refinement methods and formally relate them to several widely-used techniques, including Morgan's algorithm for molecule canonization and the Weisfeiler-Leman test. We define corresponding walk-based kernels on nodes that allow fine-grained parameterized neighborhood comparison, reach Weisfeiler-Leman expressiveness, and are computed using the kernel trick. From this we show that classical random walk kernels with only minor modifications regarding definition and computation are as expressive as the widely-used Weisfeiler-Leman subtree kernel but support non-strict neighborhood comparison. We verify experimentally that walk-based kernels reach or even surpass the accuracy of Weisfeiler-Leman kernels in real-world classification tasks.

    * Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) has recently become a hot research spot due to its practicability and theoretical value. Since GAD emphasizes the application and the rarity of anomalous samples, enriching the varieties of its datasets is fundamental. Thus, this paper present DGraph, a real-world dynamic graph in the finance domain. DGraph overcomes many limitations of current GAD datasets. It contains about 3M nodes, 4M dynamic edges, and 1M ground-truth nodes. We provide a comprehensive observation of DGraph, revealing that anomalous nodes and normal nodes generally have different structures, neighbor distribution, and temporal dynamics. Moreover, it suggests that 2M background nodes are also essential for detecting fraudsters. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on DGraph. Observation and experiments demonstrate that DGraph is propulsive to advance GAD research and enable in-depth exploration of anomalous nodes.

    * Abstract: We introduce the first direct policy search algorithm which provably converges to the globally optimal dynamic filter for the classical problem of predicting the outputs of a linear dynamical system, given noisy, partial observations. Despite the ubiquity of partial observability in practice, theoretical guarantees for direct policy search algorithms, one of the backbones of modern reinforcement learning, have proven difficult to achieve. This is primarily due to the degeneracies which arise when optimizing over filters that maintain an internal state. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on this challenging problem based on the notion of informativity, which intuitively requires that all components of a filter’s internal state are representative of the true state of the underlying dynamical system. We show that informativity overcomes the aforementioned degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a regularizer which explicitly enforces informativity, and establish that gradient descent on this regularized objective - combined with a “reconditioning step” – converges to the globally optimal cost at a $O(1/T)$ rate.

    * Abstract: Molecular conformer generation is a fundamental task in computational chemistry. Several machine learning approaches have been developed, but none have outperformed state-of-the-art cheminformatics methods. We propose torsional diffusion, a novel diffusion framework that operates on the space of torsion angles via a diffusion process on the hypertorus and an extrinsic-to-intrinsic score model. On a standard benchmark of drug-like molecules, torsional diffusion generates superior conformer ensembles compared to machine learning and cheminformatics methods in terms of both RMSD and chemical properties, and is orders of magnitude faster than previous diffusion-based models. Moreover, our model provides exact likelihoods, which we employ to build the first generalizable Boltzmann generator. Code is available at https://github.com/gcorso/torsional-diffusion.

    * Abstract: How does one adapt a pre-trained visual model to novel downstream tasks without task-specific finetuning or any model modification? Inspired by prompting in NLP, this paper investigates visual prompting: given input-output image example(s) of a new task at test time and a new input image, the goal is to automatically produce the output image, consistent with the given examples. We show that posing this problem as simple image inpainting -- literally just filling in a hole in a concatenated visual prompt image -- turns out to be surprisingly effective, provided that the inpainting algorithm has been trained on the right data. We train masked auto-encoders on a new dataset that we curated -- 88k unlabeled figures from academic papers sources on Arxiv. We apply visual prompting to these pretrained models and demonstrate results on various downstream image-to-image tasks, including foreground segmentation, single object detection, colorization, edge detection, etc. Project page: https://yossigandelsman.github.io/visual_prompt

    * Abstract: The recent progress in implicit 3D representation, i.e., Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), has made accurate and photorealistic 3D reconstruction possible in a differentiable manner. This new representation can effectively convey the information of hundreds of high-resolution images in one compact format and allows photorealistic synthesis of novel views. In this work, using the variant of NeRF called Plenoxels, we create the first large-scale radiance fields datasets for perception tasks, called the PeRFception, which consists of two parts that incorporate both object-centric and scene-centric scans for classification and segmentation. It shows a significant memory compression rate (96.4\%) from the original dataset, while containing both 2D and 3D information in a unified form. We construct the classification and segmentation models that directly take this radiance fields format as input and also propose a novel augmentation technique to avoid overfitting on backgrounds of images. The code and data are publicly available in "https://postech-cvlab.github.io/PeRFception/".

    * Abstract: Contrastive learning is a highly effective method for learning representations from unlabeled data. Recent works show that contrastive representations can transfer across domains, leading to simple state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised domain adaptation. In particular, a linear classifier trained to separate the representations on the source domain can also predict classes on the target domain accurately, even though the representations of the two domains are far from each other. We refer to this phenomenon as linear transferability. This paper analyzes when and why contrastive representations exhibit linear transferability in a general unsupervised domain adaptation setting. We prove that linear transferability can occur when data from the same class in different domains (e.g., photo dogs and cartoon dogs) are more related with each other than data from different classes in different domains (e.g., photo dogs and cartoon cats) are. Our analyses are in a realistic regime where the source and target domains can have unbounded density ratios and be weakly related, and they have distant representations across domains.

    * Abstract: Satellite imagery is increasingly available, high resolution, and temporally detailed. Changes in spatio-temporal datasets such as satellite images are particularly interesting as they reveal the many events and forces that shape our world. However, finding such interesting and meaningful change events from the vast data is challenging. In this paper, we present new datasets for such change events that include semantically meaningful events like road construction. Instead of manually annotating the very large corpus of satellite images, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach that takes a large spatio-temporal dataset from satellite images and finds interesting change events. To evaluate the meaningfulness on these datasets we create 2 benchmarks namely CaiRoad and CalFire which capture the events of road construction and forest fires. These new benchmarks can be used to evaluate semantic retrieval/classification performance. We explore these benchmarks qualitatively and quantitatively by using several methods and show that these new datasets are indeed challenging for many existing methods.

    * Abstract: AI-empowered drug recommendation has become an important task in healthcare research areas, which offers an additional perspective to assist human doctors with more accurate and more efficient drug prescriptions. Generally, drug recommendation is based on patients' diagnosis results in the electronic health records. We assume that there are three key factors to be addressed in drug recommendation: 1) elimination of recommendation bias due to limitations of observable information, 2) better utilization of historical health condition and 3) coordination of multiple drugs to control safety. To this end, we propose DrugRec, a causal inference based drug recommendation model. The causal graphical model can identify and deconfound the recommendation bias with front-door adjustment. Meanwhile, we model the multi-visit in the causal graph to characterize a patient's historical health conditions. Finally, we model the drug-drug interactions (DDIs) as the propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem, and solving the SAT problem can help better coordinate the recommendation. Comprehensive experiment results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the widely used datasets MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of our method.

    * Authors: Andaç Demir, Baris Coskunuzer, Yulia Gel, Ignacio Segovia-Dominguez, Yuzhou Chen, Bulent Kiziltan
    * Abstract: In computer-aided drug discovery (CADD), virtual screening (VS) is used for comparing a library of compounds against known active ligands to identify the drug candidates that are most likely to bind to a molecular target. Most VS methods to date have focused on using canonical compound representations (e.g., SMILES strings, Morgan fingerprints) or generating alternative fingerprints of the compounds by training progressively more complex variational autoencoders (VAEs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). Although VAEs and GNNs led to significant improvements in VS performance, these methods suffer from reduced performance when scaling to large virtual compound datasets. The performance of these methods has shown only incremental improvements in the past few years. To address this problem, we developed a novel method using multiparameter persistence (MP) homology that produces topological fingerprints of the compounds as multidimensional vectors. Our primary contribution is framing the VS process as a new topology-based graph ranking problem by partitioning a compound into chemical substructures informed by the periodic properties of its atoms and extracting their persistent homology features at multiple resolution levels. We show that the margin loss fine-tuning of pretrained Triplet networks attains highly competitive results in differentiating between compounds in the embedding space and ranking their likelihood of becoming effective drug candidates. We further establish theoretical guarantees for the stability properties of our proposed MP signatures, and demonstrate that our models, enhanced by the MP signatures, outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by a wide and highly statistically significant margin (e.g., 93\% gain for Cleves-Jain and 54\% gain for DUD-E Diverse dataset).

    * Abstract: In this work, we propose a universal and adaptive second-order method for minimization of second-order smooth, convex functions. Precisely, our algorithm achieves $O(\sigma / \sqrt{T})$ when the oracle feedback is stochastic with variance $\sigma$, and obtains the improved $O( 1 / T^3)$ convergence with deterministic oracles. Our method achieves this rate interpolation without knowing the nature of the oracle a priori, which was enabled by a parameter-free step-size that is oblivious to the knowledge of smoothness modulus, variance bounds and the diameter of the constrained set. To our knowledge, this is the first universal algorithm that achieves the aforementioned global guarantees within second-order convex optimization literature.

    * Abstract: Foundational Models (FMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities including zero-shot learning, high fidelity data synthesis, and out of domain generalization. However, the parameter capacity of FMs is still limited, leading to poor out-of-the-box performance of FMs on many expert tasks (e.g. retrieval of car manuals technical illustrations from language queries), data for which is either unseen or belonging to a long-tail part of the data distribution of the huge datasets used for FM pre-training. This underlines the necessity to explicitly evaluate and finetune FMs on such expert tasks, arguably ones that appear the most in practical real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a first of its kind FETA benchmark built around the task of teaching FMs to understand technical documentation, via learning to match their graphical illustrations to corresponding language descriptions. Our FETA benchmark focuses on text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval in public car manuals and sales catalogue brochures. FETA is equipped with a procedure for completely automatic annotation extraction (code would be released upon acceptance), allowing easy extension of FETA to more documentation types and application domains in the future. Our automatic annotation leads to an automated performance metric shown to be consistent with metrics computed on human-curated annotations (also released). We provide multiple baselines and analysis of popular FMs on FETA leading to several interesting findings that we believe would be very valuable to the FM community, paving the way towards real-world application of FMs for many practical expert tasks currently being `overlooked' by standard benchmarks focusing on common objects.

Our Semantic Probabilistic Layer (SPL) can model intricate correlations, and hard constraints, over a structured output space all while being amenable to end-to-end learning via maximum likelihood.SPLs combine exact probabilistic inference with logical reasoning in a clean and modular way, learning complex distributions and restricting their support to solutions of the constraint. As such, they can faithfully, and efficiently, model complex SOP tasks beyond the reach of alternative neuro-symbolic approaches. We empirically demonstrate that SPLs outperform these competitors in terms of accuracy on challenging SOP tasks such as hierarchical multi-label classification, pathfinding and preference learning, while retaining perfect constraint satisfaction.

    * Abstract: Generative models for graph data are an important research topic in machine learning. Graph data comprise two levels that are typically analyzed separately: node-level properties such as the existence of a link between a pair of nodes, and global aggregate graph-level statistics, such as motif counts.This paper proposes a new multi-level framework that jointly models node-level properties and graph-level statistics, as mutually reinforcing sources of information. We introduce a new micro-macro training objective for graph generation that combines node-level and graph-level losses. We utilize the micro-macro objective to improve graph generation with a GraphVAE, a well-established model based on graph-level latent variables, that provides fast training and generation time for medium-sized graphs. Our experiments show that adding micro-macro modeling to the GraphVAE model improves graph quality scores up to 2 orders of magnitude on five benchmark datasets, while maintaining the GraphVAE generation speed advantage.

    * Abstract: Fine-grained categories that largely share the same set of parts cannot be discriminated based on part information alone, as they mostly differ in the way the local parts relate to the overall global structure of the object. We propose Relational Proxies, a novel approach that leverages the relational information between the global and local views of an object for encoding its semantic label. Starting with a rigorous formalization of the notion of distinguishability between fine-grained categories, we prove the necessary and sufficient conditions that a model must satisfy in order to learn the underlying decision boundaries in the fine-grained setting. We design Relational Proxies based on our theoretical findings and evaluate it on seven challenging fine-grained benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them, surpassing the performance of all existing works with a margin exceeding 4% in some cases. We also experimentally validate our theory on fine-grained distinguishability and obtain consistent results across multiple benchmarks.

    * Abstract: Understanding convergence of SGD-based optimization algorithms can help deal with enormous machine learning problems. To ensure last-iterate convergence of SGD and momentum-based SGD (mSGD), the existing studies usually constrain the step size $\epsilon_{n}$ to decay as $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\epsilon_{n}^{2}<+\infty$, which however is rather conservative and may lead to slow convergence in the early stage of the iteration. In this paper, we relax this requirement by studying an alternate step size for the mSGD. First, we relax the requirement of the decay on step size to $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\epsilon_{n}^{2+\eta_{0}}<+\infty\ (0\le\eta_{0}<1/2)$. This implies that a larger step size, such as $\epsilon_{n}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ can be utilized for accelerating the mSGD in the early stage. Under this new step size and some common conditions, we prove that the gradient norm of mSGD for non-convex loss functions asymptotically decays to zero. In addition, we show that this step size can indeed help make the convergence into a neighborhood of the stationary points quicker in the early stage. In addition, we establish the convergence of mSGD under a constant step size $\epsilon_n\equiv\epsilon>0$ by removing the common requirement in the literature on the strong convexity of the loss function. Some experiments are given to illustrate the developed results.

    * Abstract: The generation of 3D molecules requires simultaneously deciding the categorical features (atom types) and continuous features (atom coordinates). Deep generative models, especially Diffusion Models (DMs), have demonstrated effectiveness in generating feature-rich geometries. However, existing DMs typically suffer from unstable probability dynamics with inefficient sampling speed. In this paper, we introduce geometric flow matching, which enjoys the advantages of both equivariant modeling and stabilized probability dynamics. More specifically, we propose a hybrid probability path where the coordinates probability path is regularized by an equivariant optimal transport, and the information between different modalities is aligned. Experimentally, the proposed method could consistently achieve better performance on multiple molecule generation benchmarks with 4.75$\times$ speed up of sampling on average.

    * Abstract: Given the recent impressive accomplishments of language models (LMs) for code generation, we explore the use of LMs as general adaptive mutation and crossover operators for an evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm.While NAS still proves too difficult a task for LMs to succeed at solely through prompting, we find that the combination of evolutionary prompt engineering with soft prompt-tuning, a method we term EvoPrompting, consistently finds diverse and high performing models. We first demonstrate that EvoPrompting is effective on the computationally efficient MNIST-1D dataset, where EvoPrompting produces convolutional architecture variants that outperform both those designed by human experts and naive few-shot prompting in terms of accuracy and model size. We then apply our method to searching for graph neural networks on the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, where EvoPrompting is able to design novel architectures that outperform current state-of-the-art models on 21 out of 30 algorithmic reasoning tasks while maintaining similar model size. EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.

    * Abstract: Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the properties of large-scale temporal graphs. Despite the ubiquity of these graphs in real-world scenarios, it's usually impractical for us to obtain the whole real-time graphs due to privacy concerns and technical limitations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of {\it Live Graph Lab} for temporal graphs, which enables open, dynamic and real transaction graphs from blockchains. Among them, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become one of the most prominent parts of blockchain over the past several years. With more than \$40 billion market capitalization, this decentralized ecosystem produces massive, anonymous and real transaction activities, which naturally forms a complicated transaction network. However, there is limited understanding about the characteristics of this emerging NFT ecosystem from a temporal graph analysis perspective. To mitigate this gap, we instantiate a live graph with NFT transaction network and investigate its dynamics to provide new observations and insights. Specifically, through downloading and parsing the NFT transaction activities, we obtain a temporal graph with more than 4.5 million nodes and 124 million edges. Then, a series of measurements are presented to understand the properties of the NFT ecosystem. Through comparisons with social, citation, and web networks, our analyses give intriguing findings and point out potential directions for future exploration. Finally, we also study machine learning models in this live graph to enrich the current datasets and provide new opportunities for the graph community.

    * Authors: Hyuna Cho, Minjae Jeong, Sooyeon Jeon, Sungsoo Ahn, Won Hwa Kim
    * Abstract: Successful graph generation depends on the accurate estimation of the joint distribution of graph components such as nodes and edges from training data. While recent deep neural networks have demonstrated sampling of realistic graphs together with diffusion models, however, they still suffer from oversmoothing problems which are inherited from conventional graph convolution and thus high-frequency characteristics of nodes and edges become intractable. To overcome such issues and generate graphs with high fidelity, this paper introduces a novel approach that captures the dependency between nodes and edges at multiple resolutions in the spectral space. By modeling the joint distribution of node and edge signals in a shared graph wavelet space, together with a score-based diffusion model, we propose a Wavelet Graph Diffusion Model (Wave-GD) which lets us sample synthetic graphs with real-like frequency characteristics of nodes and edges. Experimental results on four representative benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the Wave-GD over existing approaches, highlighting its potential for a wide range of applications that involve graph data.

    * Publisher: NeurIPS
    * Publication Date: `2023`
    * Authors: Kyriakos Flouris, Ender Konukoglu
    * Abstract: Manifold learning flows are a class of generative modelling techniques that assume a low-dimensional manifold description of the data. The embedding of such a manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via learnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly aligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the manifold and maximum likelihood can be used to optimize the network parameters. Naturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an injective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that the density aligns with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density volume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However, unless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold is not necessarily an \emph{efficient representation} of the data. Namely, the latent dimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis, with degenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a locally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical intrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space representation. Toward this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow method, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix to have few prominent and non-degenerate basis functions. We demonstrate that by minimizing the off-diagonal manifold metric elements $\ell_1$-norm, we can achieve such a basis, which is simultaneously sparse and/or orthogonal. Canonical manifold flow yields a more efficient use of the latent space, automatically generating fewer prominent and distinct dimensions to represent data, and consequently a better approximation of target distributions than other manifold flow methods in most experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores.

    * Abstract: Machine learning for differential equations paves the way for computationally efficient alternatives to numerical solvers, with potentially broad impacts in science and engineering. Though current algorithms typically require simulated training data tailored to a given setting, one may instead wish to learn useful information from heterogeneous sources, or from real dynamical systems observations that are messy or incomplete. In this work, we learn general-purpose representations of PDEs from heterogeneous data by implementing joint embedding methods for self-supervised learning (SSL), a framework for unsupervised representation learning that has had notable success in computer vision. Our representation outperforms baseline approaches to invariant tasks, such as regressing the coefficients of a PDE, while also improving the time-stepping performance of neural solvers. We hope that our proposed methodology will prove useful in the eventual development of general-purpose foundation models for PDEs.

We have developed GUI tools that enable non-expert users to specify 100 tasks inspired by real-life soft-body manipulations from online videos, which we'll make public.We leverage large language models to translate task descriptions into machine-interpretable optimization objectives. The optimization objectives can help differentiable physics solvers to solve these long-horizon multistage tasks that are challenging for previous baselines.

    * Abstract: Graph Structure Learning (GSL) has recently garnered considerable attention due to its ability to optimize both the parameters of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the computation graph structure simultaneously. Despite the proliferation of GSL methods developed in recent years, there is no standard experimental setting or fair comparison for performance evaluation, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress in this field. To fill this gap, we systematically analyze the performance of GSL in different scenarios and develop a comprehensive Graph Structure Learning Benchmark (GSLB) curated from 20 diverse graph datasets and 16 distinct GSL algorithms. Specifically, GSLB systematically investigates the characteristics of GSL in terms of three dimensions: effectiveness, robustness, and complexity. We comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art GSL algorithms in node- and graph-level tasks, and analyze their performance in robust learning and model complexity. Further, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training, evaluating, and visualizing different GSL methods. Empirical results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the ability of GSL and reveal its potential benefits on various downstream tasks, offering insights and opportunities for future research.

    * Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for a variety of tasks with implicit graphical structures, such as planning in robotics, multi-hop question answering or knowledge probing, structured commonsense reasoning, and more. While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question.

    * Abstract: A popular heuristic method for improving clustering results is to apply dimensionality reduction before running clustering algorithms.It has been observed that spectral-based dimensionality reduction tools, such as PCA or SVD, improve the performance of clustering algorithms in many applications. This phenomenon indicates that spectral method not only serves as a dimensionality reduction tool, but also contributes to the clustering procedure in some sense. It is an interesting question to understand the behavior of spectral steps in clustering problems.As an initial step in this direction, this paper studies the power of vanilla-SVD algorithm in the stochastic block model (SBM). We show that, in the symmetric setting, vanilla-SVD algorithm recovers all clusters correctly. This result answers an open question posed by Van Vu (Combinatorics Probability and Computing, 2018) in the symmetric setting.

    * Abstract: Gaussian processes are used in many machine learning applications that rely on uncertainty quantification. Recently, computational tools for working with these models in geometric settings, such as when inputs lie on a Riemannian manifold, have been developed. This raises the question: can these intrinsic models be shown theoretically to lead to better performance, compared to simply embedding all relevant quantities into $\mathbb{R}^d$ and using the restriction of an ordinary Euclidean Gaussian process? To study this, we prove optimal contraction rates for intrinsic Matérn Gaussian processes defined on compact Riemannian manifolds. We also prove analogous rates for extrinsic processes using trace and extension theorems between manifold and ambient Sobolev spaces: somewhat surprisingly, the rates obtained turn out to coincide with those of the intrinsic processes, provided that their smoothness parameters are matched appropriately. We illustrate these rates empirically on a number of examples, which, mirroring prior work, show that intrinsic processes can achieve better performance in practice. Therefore, our work shows that finer-grained analyses are needed to distinguish between different levels of data-efficiency of geometric Gaussian processes, particularly in settings which involve small data set sizes and non-asymptotic behavior.

    * Abstract: In an online social network, link recommendations are a way for users to discover relevant links to people they may know, thereby potentially increasing their engagement on the platform. However, the addition of links to a social network can also have an effect on the level of conflict in the network --- expressed in terms of polarization and disagreement. To date, however, we have very little understanding of how these two implications of link formation relate to each other: are the goals of high relevance and conflict reduction aligned, or are the links that users are most likely to accept fundamentally different from the ones with the greatest potential for reducing conflict? Here we provide the first analysis of this question, using the recently popular Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics. We first present a surprising result on how link additions shift the level of opinion conflict, followed by explanation work that relates the amount of shift to structural features of the added links. We then characterize the gap in conflict reduction between the set of links achieving the largest reduction and the set of links achieving the highest relevance. The gap is measured on real-world data, based on instantiations of relevance defined by 13 link recommendation algorithms. We find that some, but not all, of the more accurate algorithms actually lead to better reduction of conflict. Our work suggests that social links recommended for increasing user engagement may not be as conflict-provoking as people might have thought.

    * Abstract: One-shot channel simulation is a fundamental data compression problem concerned with encoding a single sample from a target distribution $Q$ using a coding distribution $P$ using as few bits as possible on average. Algorithms that solve this problem find applications in neural data compression and differential privacy and can serve as a more efficient and natural alternative to quantization-based methods. Unfortunately, existing solutions are too slow or have limited applicability, preventing their widespread adaptation. In this paper, we conclusively solve one-shot channel simulation for one-dimensional problems where the target-proposal density ratio is unimodal by describing an algorithm with optimal runtime. We achieve this by constructing a rejection sampling procedure equivalent to greedily searching over the points of a Poisson process. Hence, we call our algorithm greedy Poisson rejection sampling (GPRS) and analyze the correctness and time complexity of several of its variants. Finally, we empirically verify our theorems, demonstrating that GPRS significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, A* coding.

The role of these physics is unclear, however, with successful examples of both reversible (e.g., Hamiltonian) and irreversible (e.g., diffusion) phenomena producing comparable results despite diametrically opposed mechanisms, and further complications arising due to empirical departures from mathematical theory. This work presents a series of novel GNN architectures based upon structure-preserving bracket-based dynamical systems, which are provably guaranteed to either conserve energy or generate positive dissipation with increasing depth. It is shown that the theoretically principled framework employed here allows for inherently explainable constructions, which contextualize departures from theory in current architectures and better elucidate the roles of reversibility and irreversibility in network performance.

    * Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for learning general-purpose skills by reaching diverse goals. However, it has limitations when it comes to task-conditioned policies, where goals are specified by temporally extended instructions written in the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formal language. Existing approaches for finding LTL-satisfying policies rely on sampling a large set of LTL instructions during training to adapt to unseen tasks at inference time. However, these approaches do not guarantee generalization to out-of-distribution LTL objectives, which may have increased complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this challenge. We show that simple goal-conditioned RL agents can be instructed to follow arbitrary LTL specifications without additional training over the LTL task space. Unlike existing approaches that focus on LTL specifications expressible as regular expressions, our technique is unrestricted and generalizes to $\omega$-regular expressions. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in adapting goal-conditioned RL agents to satisfy complex temporal logic task specifications zero-shot.

    * Abstract: This work presents a graph neural network (GNN) framework for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, inspired by dynamic programming (DP). Specifically, given a graph, we propose a DP-like recursive algorithm based on GNNs that firstly constructs two smaller sub-graphs, predicts the one with the larger MIS, and then uses it in the next recursive call. To train our algorithm, we require annotated comparisons of different graphs concerning their MIS size. Annotating the comparisons with the output of our algorithm leads to a self-training process that results in more accurate self-annotation of the comparisons and vice versa. We provide numerical evidence showing the superiority of our method vs prior methods in multiple synthetic and real-world datasets.

    * Abstract: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods typically assume that all semantic classes to be segmented would be available during training and only seen categories are segmented at inference. We argue that such a closed-world assumption is restrictive and explore for the first time 3D indoor instance segmentation in an open-world setting, where the model is allowed to distinguish a set of known classes as well as identify an unknown object as unknown and then later incrementally learning the semantic category of the unknown when the corresponding category labels are available. To this end, we introduce an open-world 3D indoor instance segmentation method, where an auto-labeling scheme is employed to produce pseudo-labels during training and induce separation to separate known and unknown category labels. We further improve the pseudo-labels quality at inference by adjusting the unknown class probability based on the objectness score distribution. We also introduce carefully curated open-world splits leveraging realistic scenarios based on inherent object distribution, region-based indoor scene exploration and randomness aspect of open-world classes. Extensive experiments reveal the efficacy of the proposed contributions leading to promising open-world 3D instance segmentation performance.

    * Abstract: Many approaches in machine learning rely on a weighted graph to encode thesimilarities between samples in a dataset. Entropic affinities (EAs), which are notably used in the popular Dimensionality Reduction (DR) algorithm t-SNE, are particular instances of such graphs. To ensure robustness to heterogeneous sampling densities, EAs assign a kernel bandwidth parameter to every sample in such a way that the entropy of each row in the affinity matrix is kept constant at a specific value, whose exponential is known as perplexity. EAs are inherently asymmetric and row-wise stochastic, but they are used in DR approaches after undergoing heuristic symmetrization methods that violate both the row-wise constant entropy and stochasticity properties. In this work, we uncover a novel characterization of EA as an optimal transport problem, allowing a natural symmetrization that can be computed efficiently using dual ascent. The corresponding novel affinity matrix derives advantages from symmetric doubly stochastic normalization in terms of clustering performance, while also effectively controlling the entropy of each row thus making it particularly robust to varying noise levels. Following, we present a new DR algorithm, SNEkhorn, that leverages this new affinity matrix. We show its clear superiority to state-of-the-art approaches with several indicators on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

    * Authors: Gabriel Sarch, Michael Tarr, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Leila Wehbe
    * Abstract: The alignment between deep neural network (DNN) features and cortical responses currently provides the most accurate quantitative explanation for higher visual areas. At the same time, these model features have been critiqued as uninterpretable explanations, trading one black box (the human brain) for another (a neural network). In this paper, we train networks to directly predict, from scratch, brain responses to images from a large-scale dataset of natural scenes (Allen et. al., 2021). We then use "network dissection" (Bau et. al., 2017), an explainable AI technique used for enhancing neural network interpretability by identifying and localizing the most significant features in images for individual units of a trained network, and which has been used to study category selectivity in the human brain (Khosla & Wehbe, 2022). We adapt this approach to create a hypothesis-neutral model that is then used to explore the tuning properties of specific visual regions beyond category selectivity, which we call "brain dissection". We use brain dissection to examine a range of ecologically important, intermediate properties, including depth, surface normals, curvature, and object relations across sub-regions of the parietal, lateral, and ventral visual streams, and scene-selective regions. Our findings reveal distinct preferences in brain regions for interpreting visual scenes, with ventro-lateral areas favoring closer and curvier features, medial and parietal areas opting for more varied and flatter 3D elements, and the parietal region uniquely preferring spatial relations. Scene-selective regions exhibit varied preferences, as the retrosplenial complex prefers distant and outdoor features, while the occipital and parahippocampal place areas favor proximity, verticality, and in the case of the OPA, indoor elements. Such findings show the potential of using explainable AI to uncover spatial feature selectivity across the visual cortex, contributing to a deeper, more fine-grained understanding of the functional characteristics of human visual cortex when viewing natural scenes.

    * Abstract: We introduce Stanford-ORB, a new real-world 3D Object inverse Rendering Benchmark. Recent advances in inverse rendering have enabled a wide range of real-world applications in 3D content generation, moving rapidly from research and commercial use cases to consumer devices. While the results continue to improve, there is no real-world benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of various inverse rendering methods. Existing real-world datasets typically only consist of the shape and multi-view images of objects, which are not sufficient for evaluating the quality of material recovery and object relighting. Methods capable of recovering material and lighting often resort to synthetic data for quantitative evaluation, which on the other hand does not guarantee generalization to complex real-world environments. We introduce a new dataset of real-world objects captured under a variety of natural scenes with ground-truth 3D scans, multi-view images, and environment lighting. Using this dataset, we establish the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for object inverse rendering tasks from in-the-wild scenes, and compare the performance of various existing methods.

    * Abstract: Images generated by diffusion models like Stable Diffusion are increasingly widespread. Recent works and even lawsuits have shown that these models are prone to replicating their training data, unbeknownst to the user. In this paper, we first analyze this memorization problem in text-to-image diffusion models. While it is widely believed that duplicated images in the training set are responsible for content replication at inference time, we observe that the text conditioning of the model plays a similarly important role. In fact, we see in our experiments that data replication often does not happen for unconditional models, while it is common in the text-conditional case. Motivated by our findings, we then propose several techniques for reducing data replication at both training and inference time by randomizing and augmenting image captions in the training set.

    * Abstract: Deployed language models decay over time due to shifting inputs, changing user needs, or emergent world-knowledge gaps. When such problems are identified, we want to make targeted edits while avoiding expensive retraining. However, current model editors, which modify such behaviors of pre-trained models, degrade model performance quickly across multiple, sequential edits. We propose GRACE, a \textit{lifelong} model editing method, which implements spot-fixes on streaming errors of a deployed model, ensuring minimal impact on unrelated inputs. GRACE writes new mappings into a pre-trained model's latent space, creating a discrete, local codebook of edits without altering model weights. This is the first method enabling thousands of sequential edits using only streaming errors. Our experiments on T5, BERT, and GPT models show GRACE's state-of-the-art performance in making and retaining edits, while generalizing to unseen inputs.

    * Abstract: This paper focuses on improving the reconstruction of 2D floorplans from unstructured 3D point clouds. We identify opportunities for enhancement over the existing methods in three main areas: semantic quality, efficient representation, and local geometric details. To address these, we presents SLIBO-Net, an innovative approach to reconstructing 2D floorplans from unstructured 3D point clouds. We propose a novel transformer-based architecture that employs an efficient floorplan representation, providing improved room shape supervision and allowing for manageable token numbers. By incorporating geometric priors as a regularization mechanism and post-processing step, we enhance the capture of local geometric details. We also propose a scale-independent evaluation metric, correcting the discrepancy in error treatment between varying floorplan sizes. Our approach notably achieves a new state-of-the-art on the Structure3D dataset. The resultant floorplans exhibit enhanced semantic plausibility, substantially improving the overall quality and realism of the reconstructions. Our code and dataset are available online.

    * Abstract: Real-world data is complex and often consists of objects that can be decomposed into multiple entities (e.g. images into pixels, graphs into interconnected nodes). Randomized smoothing is a powerful framework for making models provably robust against small changes to their inputs - by guaranteeing robustness of the majority vote when randomly adding noise before classification. Yet, certifying robustness on such complex data via randomized smoothing is challenging when adversaries do not arbitrarily perturb entire objects (e.g. images) but only a subset of their entities (e.g. pixels). As a solution, we introduce hierarchical randomized smoothing: We partially smooth objects by adding random noise only on a randomly selected subset of their entities. By adding noise in a more targeted manner than existing methods we obtain stronger robustness guarantees while maintaining high accuracy. We initialize hierarchical smoothing using different noising distributions, yielding novel robustness certificates for discrete and continuous domains. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of hierarchical smoothing in image and node classification, where it yields superior robustness-accuracy trade-offs. Overall, hierarchical smoothing is an important contribution towards models that are both - certifiably robust to perturbations and accurate.

    * Abstract: Webly supervised learning has attracted increasing attention for its effectiveness in exploring publicly accessible data at scale without manual annotation. However, most existing methods of learning with web datasets are faced with challenges from label noise, and they have limited assumptions on clean samples under various noise. For instance, web images retrieved with queries of ”tiger cat“ (a cat species) and ”drumstick“ (a musical instrument) are almost dominated by images of tigers and chickens, which exacerbates the challenge of fine-grained visual concept learning. In this case, exploiting both web images and their associated texts is a requisite solution to combat real-world noise. In this paper, we propose Cross-modality Aligned Prototypes (CAPro), a unified prototypical contrastive learning framework to learn visual representations with correct semantics. For one thing, we leverage textual prototypes, which stem from the distinct concept definition of classes, to select clean images by text matching and thus disambiguate the formation of visual prototypes. For another, to handle missing and mismatched noisy texts, we resort to the visual feature space to complete and enhance individual texts and thereafter improve text matching. Such semantically aligned visual prototypes are further polished up with high-quality samples, and engaged in both cluster regularization and noise removal. Besides, we propose collective bootstrapping to encourage smoother and wiser label reference from appearance-similar instances in a manner of dictionary look-up. Extensive experiments on WebVision1k and NUS-WIDE (Web) demonstrate that CAPro well handles realistic noise under both single-label and multi-label scenarios. CAPro achieves new state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robustness to open-set recognition. Codes are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/capro.

In the pursuit of fixing adversarial training (1) we show and overcome fundamental theoretical as well as practical limitations of the adopted graph learning setting in prior work; (2) we reveal that flexible GNNs based on learnable graph diffusion are able to adjust to adversarial perturbations, while the learned message passing scheme is naturally interpretable; (3) we introduce the first attack for structure perturbations that, while targeting multiple nodes at once, is capable of handling global (graph-level) as well as local (node-level) constraints. Including these contributions, we demonstrate that adversarial training is a state-of-the-art defense against adversarial structure perturbations.

    * Authors: Puhua Jiang, Mingze Sun, Ruqi Huang
    * Abstract: In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for non-rigid shape registra- tion without correspondence supervision. Traditional shape registration techniques typically rely on correspondences induced by extrinsic proximity, therefore can fail in the presence of large intrinsic deformations. Spectral mapping methods overcome this challenge by embedding shapes into, geometric or learned, high- dimensional spaces, where shapes are easier to align. However, due to the dependency on abstract, non-linear embedding schemes, the latter can be vulnerable with respect to perturbed or alien input. In light of this, our framework takes the best of both worlds. Namely, we deform source mesh towards the target point cloud, guided by correspondences induced by high-dimensional embeddings learned from deep functional maps (DFM). In particular, the correspondences are dynamically updated according to the intermediate registrations and filtered by consistency prior, which prominently robustify the overall pipeline. Moreover, in order to alleviate the requirement of extrinsically aligned input, we train an orientation regressor on a set of aligned synthetic shapes independent of the training shapes for DFM. Empirical results show that, with as few as dozens of training shapes of limited variability, our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks of non-rigid point cloud matching, but also delivers high-quality correspondences between unseen challenging shape pairs that undergo both significant extrinsic and intrinsic defor- mations, in which case neither traditional registration methods nor intrinsic methods work.

    * Abstract: Federated learning has a significant advantage in protecting information privacy. Many scholars proposed various secure learning methods within the framework of federated learning but the study on secure federated unsupervised learning especially clustering is limited. We in this work propose a secure kernelized factorization method for federated spectral clustering on distributed dataset. The method is non-trivial because the kernel or similarity matrix for spectral clustering is computed by data pairs, which violates the principle of privacy protection. Our method implicitly constructs an approximation for the kernel matrix on distributed data such that we can perform spectral clustering under the constraint of privacy protection. We provide a convergence guarantee of the optimization algorithm, reconstruction error bounds of the Gaussian kernel matrix, and the sufficient condition of correct clustering of our method. We also present some results of differential privacy. Numerical results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient and accurate in comparison to the baselines.

    * Abstract: We provide new algorithms and conditional hardness for the problem of estimating effective resistances in $n$-node $m$-edge undirected, expander graphs. We provide an $\widetilde{O}(m\epsilon^{-1})$-time algorithm that produces with high probability, an $\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-1})$-bit sketch from which the effective resistance between any pair of nodes can be estimated, to $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-multiplicative accuracy, in $\widetilde{O}(1)$-time. Consequently, we obtain an $\widetilde{O}(m\epsilon^{-1})$-time algorithm for estimating the effective resistance of all edges in such graphs, improving (for sparse graphs) on the previous fastest runtimes of $\widetilde{O}(m\epsilon^{-3/2})$ [Chu et. al. 2018] and $\widetilde{O}(n^2\epsilon^{-1})$ [Jambulapati, Sidford, 2018] for general graphs and $\widetilde{O}(m + n\epsilon^{-2})$ for expanders [Li, Sachdeva 2022]. We complement this result by showing a conditional lower bound that a broad set of algorithms for computing such estimates of the effective resistances between all pairs of nodes require $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^2 \epsilon^{-1/2})$-time, improving upon the previous best such lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^2 \epsilon^{-1/13})$ [Musco et. al. 2017]. Further, we leverage the tools underlying these results to obtain improved algorithms and conditional hardness for more general problems of sketching the pseudoinverse of positive semidefinite matrices and estimating functions of their eigenvalues.

    * Abstract: Goal-conditioned policies are generally understood to be "feed-forward" circuits, in the form of neural networks that map from the current state and the goal specification to the next action to take. However, under what circumstances such a policy can be learned and how efficient the policy will be are not well understood. In this paper, we present a circuit complexity analysis for relational neural networks (such as graph neural networks and transformers) representing policies for planning problems, by drawing connections with serialized goal regression search (S-GRS). We show that there are three general classes of planning problems, in terms of the growth of circuit width and depth as a function of the number of objects and planning horizon, providing constructive proofs. We also illustrate the utility of this analysis for designing neural networks for policy learning.

    * Authors: Yibo Jiang, Bryon Aragam
    * Abstract: We establish conditions under which latent causal graphs are nonparametrically identifiable and can be reconstructed from unknown interventions in the latent space. Our primary focus is the identification of the latent structure in measurement models without parametric assumptions such as linearity or Gaussianity. Moreover, we do not assume the number of hidden variables is known, and we show that at most one unknown intervention per hidden variable is needed. This extends a recent line of work on learning causal representations from observations and interventions. The proofs are constructive and introduce two new graphical concepts---imaginary subsets and isolated edges---that may be useful in their own right. As a matter of independent interest, the proofs also involve a novel characterization of the limits of edge orientations within the equivalence class of DAGs induced by unknown interventions. These are the first results to characterize the conditions under which causal representations are identifiable without making any parametric assumptions in a general setting with unknown interventions and without faithfulness.

    * Abstract: Recent advances in fine-grained representation learning leverage local-to-global (emergent) relationships for achieving state-of-the-art results. The relational representations relied upon by such methods, however, are abstract. We aim to deconstruct this abstraction by expressing them as interpretable graphs over image views. We begin by theoretically showing that abstract relational representations are nothing but a way of recovering transitive relationships among local views. Based on this, we design Transitivity Recovering Decompositions (TRD), a graph-space search algorithm that identifies interpretable equivalents of abstract emergent relationships at both instance and class levels, and with no post-hoc computations. We additionally show that TRD is provably robust to noisy views, with empirical evidence also supporting this finding. The latter allows TRD to perform at par or even better than the state-of-the-art, while being fully interpretable. Implementation is available at https://github.com/abhrac/trd.

    * Abstract: Finding new drugs is getting harder and harder. One of the hopes of drug discovery is to use machine learning models to predict molecular properties. That is why models for molecular property prediction are being developed and tested on benchmarks such as MoleculeNet. However, existing benchmarks are unrealistic and are too different from applying the models in practice. We have created a new practical \emph{Lo-Hi} benchmark consisting of two tasks: Lead Optimization (Lo) and Hit Identification (Hi), corresponding to the real drug discovery process. For the Hi task, we designed a novel molecular splitting algorithm that solves the Balanced Vertex Minimum $k$-Cut problem. We tested state-of-the-art and classic ML models, revealing which works better under practical settings. We analyzed modern benchmarks and showed that they are unrealistic and overoptimistic.Review: https://openreview.net/forum?id=H2Yb28qGLVLo-Hi benchmark: https://github.com/SteshinSS/lohi_neurips2023Lo-Hi splitter library: https://github.com/SteshinSS/lohi_splitter

    * Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful technique for learning on relational data. Owing to the relatively limited number of message passing steps they perform—and hence a smaller receptive field—there has been significant interest in improving their expressivity by incorporating structural aspects of the underlying graph. In this paper, we explore the use of affinity measures as features in graph neural networks, in particular measures arising from random walks, including effective resistance, hitting and commute times. We propose message passing networks based on these features and evaluate their performance on a variety of node and graph property prediction tasks. Our architecture has low computational complexity, while our features are invariant to the permutations of the underlying graph. The measures we compute allow the network to exploit the connectivity properties of the graph, thereby allowing us to outperform relevant benchmarks for a wide variety of tasks, often with significantly fewer message passing steps. On one of the largest publicly available graph regression datasets, OGB-LSC-PCQM4Mv1, we obtain the best known single-model validation MAE at the time of writing.

    * Abstract: Automated creation of synthetic traffic scenarios is a key part of scaling the safety validation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we propose Scenario Diffusion, a novel diffusion-based architecture for generating traffic scenarios that enables controllable scenario generation. We combine latent diffusion, object detection and trajectory regression to generate distributions of synthetic agent poses, orientations and trajectories simultaneously. This distribution is conditioned on the map and sets of tokens describing the desired scenario to provide additional control over the generated scenario. We show that our approach has sufficient expressive capacity to model diverse traffic patterns and generalizes to different geographical regions.

    * Abstract: Finding the proper depth $d$ of a graph convolutional network (GCN) that provides strong representation ability has drawn significant attention, yet nonetheless largely remains an open problem for the graph learning community. Although noteworthy progress has been made, the depth or the number of layers of a corresponding GCN is realized by a series of graph convolution operations, which naturally makes $d$ a positive integer ($d \in \mathbb{N}+$). An interesting question is whether breaking the constraint of $\mathbb{N}+$ by making $d$ a real number ($d \in \mathbb{R}$) can bring new insights into graph learning mechanisms. In this work, by redefining GCN's depth $d$ as a trainable parameter continuously adjustable within $(-\infty,+\infty)$, we open a new door of controlling its signal processing capability to model graph homophily/heterophily (nodes with similar/dissimilar labels/attributes tend to be inter-connected). A simple and powerful GCN model TEDGCN, is proposed to retain the simplicity of GCN and meanwhile automatically search for the optimal $d$ without the prior knowledge regarding whether the input graph is homophilic or heterophilic. Negative-valued $d$ intrinsically enables high-pass frequency filtering functionality via augmented topology for graph heterophily. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TEDGCN on node classification tasks for a variety of homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

    * Authors: Kai Tan, Pierre C Bellec
    * Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) in multinomial logistic models in the high-dimensional regime where dimension and sample size are of the same order. While classical large-sample theory provides asymptotic normality of the MLE under certain conditions, such classical results are expected to fail in high-dimensions as documented for the binary logistic case in the seminal work of Sur and Candès [2019]. We address this issue in classification problems with 3 or more classes, by developing asymptotic normality and asymptotic chi-square results for the multinomial logistic MLE (also known as cross-entropy minimizer) on null covariates. Our theory leads to a new methodology to test the significance of a given feature. Extensive simulation studies on synthetic data corroborate these asymptotic results and confirm the validity of proposed p-values for testing the significance of a given feature.

    * Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) serves as a powerful tool to model the underlying manifold structures of samples in high-dimensional spaces. It involves two phases: constructing an affinity graph from available data and inferring labels for unlabeled nodes on this graph. While numerous algorithms have been developed for label inference, the crucial graph construction phase has received comparatively less attention, despite its significant influence on the subsequent phase. In this paper, we present an optimal asymmetric graph structure for the label inference phase with theoretical motivations. Unlike existing graph construction methods, we differentiate the distinct roles that labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes could play. Accordingly, we design an efficient block-wise graph learning algorithm with a global convergence guarantee. Other benefits induced by our method, such as enhanced robustness to noisy node features, are explored as well. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art graph construction methods in GSSL.

    * Abstract: Similar to community detection, partitioning the nodes of a complex network according to their structural roles aims to identify fundamental building blocks of a network, which can be used, e.g., to find simplified descriptions of the network connectivity, to derive reduced order models for dynamical processes unfolding on processes, or as ingredients for various network analysis and graph mining tasks. In this work, we offer a fresh look on the problem of role extraction and its differences to community detection and present a definition of node roles and two associated optimization problems (cost functions) grounded in ideas related to graph-isomorphism tests, the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and equitable partitions. We present theoretical guarantees and validate our approach via a novel “role-infused partition benchmark”, a network model from which we can sample networks in which nodes are endowed with different roles in a stochastic way.

    * Abstract: We study the problem of estimating precision matrices in Gaussian distributions that are multivariate totally positive of order two ($\mathrm{MTP}_2$). The precision matrix in such a distribution is an M-matrix. This problem can be formulated as a sign-constrained log-determinant program. Current algorithms are designed using the block coordinate descent method or the proximal point algorithm, which becomes computationally challenging in high-dimensional cases due to the requirement to solve numerous nonnegative quadratic programs or large-scale linear systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm based on the two-metric projection method, incorporating a carefully designed search direction and variable partitioning scheme. Our algorithm substantially reduces computational complexity, and its theoretical convergence is established. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    * Abstract: Designing models that are both expressive and preserve known invariances of tasks is an increasingly hard problem. Existing solutions tradeoff invariance for computational or memory resources. In this work, we show how to leverage randomness and design models that are both expressive and invariant but use less resources. Inspired by randomized algorithms, our key insight is that accepting probabilistic notions of universal approximation and invariance can reduce our resource requirements. More specifically, we propose a class of binary classification models called Randomized Linear Classifiers (RLCs). We give parameter and sample size conditions in which RLCs can, with high probability, approximate any (smooth) function while preserving invariance to compact group transformations. Leveraging this result, we design three RLCs that are provably probabilistic invariant for classification tasks over sets, graphs, and spherical data. We show how these models can achieve probabilistic invariance and universality using less resources than (deterministic) neural networks and their invariant counterparts. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the benefits of this new class of models on invariant tasks where deterministic invariant neural networks are known to struggle.

    * Abstract: In reliable decision-making systems based on machine learning, models have to be robust to distributional shifts or provide the uncertainty of their predictions. In node-level problems of graph learning, distributional shifts can be especially complex since the samples are interdependent. To evaluate the performance of graph models, it is important to test them on diverse and meaningful distributional shifts. However, most graph benchmarks considering distributional shifts for node-level problems focus mainly on node features, while structural properties are also essential for graph problems. In this work, we propose a general approach for inducing diverse distributional shifts based on graph structure. We use this approach to create data splits according to several structural node properties: popularity, locality, and density. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed distributional shifts and show that they can be quite challenging for existing graph models. We also reveal that simple models often outperform more sophisticated methods on the considered structural shifts. Finally, our experiments provide evidence that there is a trade-off between the quality of learned representations for the base classification task under structural distributional shift and the ability to separate the nodes from different distributions using these representations.

    * Abstract: We consider the problem of variational Bayesian inference in a latent variable model where a (possibly complex) observed stochastic process is governed by the unobserved solution of a latent stochastic differential equation (SDE). Motivated by the challenges that arise when trying to learn a latent SDE in $\mathbb{R}^n$ from large-scale data, such as efficient gradient computation, we take a step back and study a specific subclass instead. In our case, the SDE evolves inside a homogeneous latent space and is induced by stochastic dynamics of the corresponding (matrix) Lie group. In the context of learning problems, SDEs on the $n$-dimensional unit sphere are arguably the most relevant incarnation of this setup. For variational inference, the sphere not only facilitates using a uniform prior on the initial state of the SDE, but we also obtain a particularly simple and intuitive expression for the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and prior process in the evidence lower bound. We provide empirical evidence that a latent SDE of the proposed type can be learned efficiently by means of an existing one-step geometric Euler-Maruyama scheme. Despite restricting ourselves to a less diverse class of SDEs, we achieve competitive or even state-of-the-art performance on a collection of time series interpolation and classification benchmarks.
