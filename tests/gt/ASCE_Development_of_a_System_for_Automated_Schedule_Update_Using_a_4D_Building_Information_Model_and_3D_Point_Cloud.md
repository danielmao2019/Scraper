    * Abstract: Correctly generating and updating a schedule are critical to the success of a construction project. However, current schedule update techniques are inaccurate and inefficient because they still rely heavily on manual effort. Although some research proposed an automated schedule update system, it has certain limitations because it uses limited information. This paper describes the development and implementation of a system that automates schedule update using valuable information in the 4D building information model (BIM). The performance of the system was evaluated using a 3D point cloud, obtained during the construction of a project. The developed system improves the schedule update process by integrating 4D BIM with the 3D point cloud. In comparison to current systems, this paper demonstrates a new thinking paradigm in the schedule update process, by using 4D BIM.
