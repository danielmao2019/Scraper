    * Abstract: In this letter, a pointwise approach using stereo-graph cuts (SGC) with spatio-temporal information is proposed for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection. The SGC is based on stereo-graph, which is designed to connect the local maximum pixels on two SAR images and can be used to capture the spatio-temporal information. With the support of stereo-graph, a novel SGC energy function is presented to quantify the spatio-temporal information and implicitly measure the difference information between the SAR images. Therefore, the change detection results can be obtained by minimizing the energy function with graph cuts technology. Experimental results on real SAR datasets confirm the validity of the proposed approach in which SGC and spatio-temporal information offer great contributions on improving the robustness and accuracy of detection.
